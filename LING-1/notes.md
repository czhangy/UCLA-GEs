# LING 1 - Fall '20 - Silvestri

## **10/2: Introduction**

- Linguistics is the scientific study of language
  - We make observations about what people say
  - We form hypotheses and test them against data to revise them
  - We develop a theory matching the results
- Language is an instinct that we act on in daily life
  - Just like our visual system is a subconscious process
  - Many facets of language operate subconsciously
  - Conscious knowledge doesn't take away these processes effects
    - You can't force yourself to not understand language if you understand it
- Language is a kind of tool
  - A tool for communication used to express meaning encoded into sounds/hand shapes
  - Listeners decode speech into meaning
- Language is a kind of knowledge
  - What do you know when you know a language?
    - You have a system of knowledge - grammar - that gives us building blocks that we can use to create more complex structures
    - We know how to use this system
  - This is a type of unconscious knowledge
    - Expletive infixation → rules that we inherently follow without even knowing them
  - Phonetics - we understand the inventory of our language
    - McGurk Effect shows that we intuitively know the mouth shape of a particular sound
    - Mismatch between what we hear and what we see → changing perceptions
    - Doesn't matter if we consciously know what sound we're hearing
  - Phonology - understanding the possible sound patterns in our language
    - Tested with Jean-Burko Gleeson's Wug Test - forms plurals of nonsense nouns → shows we don't have a known list of plurals, we intuitively have a rule system to form plurals
  - Morphology - we know a variety of words in our language
    - We know potential words and we can form complex words from less complex ones
      - Differ → different → different
    - We have a lexicon - our mental dictionary of words we know
      - We likely have words that are not in any written dictionary
    - We know there are constraints to how a word can be built
  - Syntax - we know how to build phrases and sentences
  - Semantics - we know how to assign meanings to words in sentences
  - Reading and writing are not part of knowledge of linguistics
    - For most of human history, reading and writing were not available
    - Focus on spoken language
  - Native speakers may not know the history of words in their language → doesn't play a role in the knowledge of language
  - Being a fully competent native speaker of a language is independent of educational level
    - Being more or less educated has no effect
- Distinguish between linguistic competence and linguistic performance
  - Linguistic competence : what you know in your mind, what you can do, systematic knowledge of building blocks
  - Linguistic performance : what you actually do, what actually comes out of your mouth, subject to physical limitations
    - Performance errors like slips of the tongue
- Can we find a set of properties that all human languages share?
- Features of language
  - Arbitrariness - the relationship between a form and meaning in a word is arbitrary
    - Pseudo-exceptions: onomatopoeic words → still have some differences between language
  - Creativity - speakers use a finite set of building blocks to create and understand an infinitude of novel sentences
    - Sentences cannot simply be memorized or learned by imitation
    - Especially evident in children
    - Emphasized by Noam Chomsky
    - There's no limit to how long a sentence can be
- The set of universal properties possessed by all human languages - Universal Grammar
  - Can be thought of as a set of laws for human language
  - All languages have a lexicon, phonetic system, phonology, morphology, syntactic structure, and semantics
  - True for spoken and signed languages
  - All languages have ways of forming questions, negating a sentence, have means to indicate action, possess a set of discrete sounds
- Development of grammar
  - All children
    - Acquire the language of their environment
    - Acquire language spontaneously
    - Exhibit linguistic creativity
    - Pass through similar stages as they build their own grammar
      - Babbling → babbling to specific language sounds → single-word utterances → two-word utterances → overgeneralizations → most fully acquire by 5
    - Suggests there's a strong biological component to language development → supports UG
- Two types of grammar
  - Descriptive grammar - linguist's description or model of the mental grammar
    - What speaker's rules actually are
  - Prescriptive grammar - rules of grammar used by teachers, for example
    - What the speaker's rules should be
    - Can you understand people when they break these rules?
    - Ex. Double negatives in English, stranded/dangling prepositions

## **10/7: Intro to Linguistics**

- The language instinct
  - We humans, all of us, are all capable of intuitions about language
- Lingua - Latin for language and tongue
  - Linguistics and language both come from this root word
- Linguistics is the science of the human faculty of language
- Ferdinand de Saussure (1853-1917) → when it comes to language, we need to study human beings that speak it
- One human cognitive faculty → many languages spoken in the world
- Case study: Italy and its linguistic landscape
  - Italian is not the language of Italy → Italo-Romance varieties → called dialects
- Diglossia - speaker is able to speak 2 systems based on different social situations, functionally-determined language choice
  - Occurs in situations of long standing societal multilingualism
  - 2+ languages: high and low, used by virtually everyone in the society
    - High language: in formal domains
      - Used to talk to strangers, bosses, teachers, etc.
      - Largely school-learned
- Understanding the tension between language diversity and identity is one of the most fruitful research agenda of modern linguistic theory
- Grammar is knowledge of a language's sound system, its words (meanings and forms), and its sentences
  - Such knowledge is usually unconscious
  - The other component of language is called a lexicon
- Why study language?
  - The questions that we try to ask and answer when we study language contribute to answer the ultimate questions about human beings

## **10/12: Language and Dialect**

- Language variations/dialect differences
  - Is the way that any one person or group of people speak better than anyone else's?
- What is a dialect?
  - Popular: a dialect is a type of pseudo-language spoken by uneducated people
  - Popular: a type of speech that's different from your own
  - Popular: a dialect is a corrupt form of the language it's derived from
  - Popular: dialect are perceived as lacking grammar
  - A dialect refers to any variety of language spoken by a group of speakers
    - Everyone speaks a dialect
    - There's no such thing as a god or bad dialect
    - A language is a collection of dialects, one of which has been adopted as the standard variety, which people think of as "the language"
      - Assigned for a variety of social/historical reasons
- Characteristics of a Standard Language
  - The dialect of the ruling or most influential class is adopted as the standard
  - Literacy → acquires a written form
  - Standardization → a grammar that provides the rules of the language
  - Has an authoritative dictionary
  - Spelling/writing is fixed → out of competing forms, a single one is adopted as correct
  - A correct pronunciation
  - Public life → taught in school, used in an official setting
- Language Variations
  - One dialect is often considered a prestige dialect
  - Often associated with positive attributes: education, sophistication, intelligence
  - Others are substandard
  - Associated with the reverse: ignorance, lack of education, laziness
- Understanding Variation
  - Language is used differently in different contexts
  - Varies according to geography, social class, political ideology, age, gender, sexual orientation, situation, time
- Geographic Variation
  - If variation is based on geography, we focus on geographic variations
    - Soda vs. pop vs. coke
  - American dialect vs. British dialect
- AAVE - African American Vernacular English
  - Sociolinguistic focus on AAVE after Civil Rights Movement for integration in schools
  - Be-deletion → occurs when SAE can use contractions
- Social Variation
  - Eckert Study
    - Studied a high school in Detroit, focusing on jocks vs. burnouts
      - Jocks - middle-class, intent to leave after graduation
      - Burnouts - working-class background, local friends, intent to stay
    - Strong correlation between social status and negative concord
      - Jock girls < jock boys < burnout girls < burnout boys < "burned out" burnout girls
  - Class-based h-deletion in Norwich
    - Social class up, h-deletion down
  - Variation in use of standard 3rd singular present `-s` in verbs
    - Social class up, `-s` drop down
- Notions of Correctness
  - Standard language form is thought of as the correct form → speakers have higher prestige
  - Educational System - teaches correct and incorrect grammar
  - Government - only standard form is used in official gov't business
  - Social class - linguistic properties are often correlated with socio-economic status
- Stigmatization
  - Double negation
  - Regularized verb forms
  - Different subject-verb agreement patterns
  - Ain't
- English Dialect Case Study - Singlish
  - Singapore is a highly ethnically diverse country
  - Lots of native speakers
  - Singapore is highly multilingual → get to see what kind of English arose as a result of this
    - 4 official languages: Malay, Mandarin,Tamil, and English
    - English is the de facto language of gov't
    - English promoted as a neutral language
  - Strongly stigmatized → "English corrupted by Singaporeans"
    - Speak Good English movement
  - Discourse particles
    - Spoken indication of speaker's attitude
    - "Lah" - reassurance, impatience
    - "What" - marks obviousness or a contradiction
    - "Meh" - indicates surprise or skepticism
- Register Variation
  - Level of formality
  - Case study - "like" - not a marker of a particular dialect, used colloquially across multiple dialects
    - Critics concerned with the supposed deterioration of the English language
    - Use is meaningless, thought of as indicative of a limited vocabulary → wrong
      - Used as a quotative complementizer
      - Used as signal approximation/an approximative adverb
      - Used as a discourse marker → signals relationship between sentences
        - Could be exemplification, illustration, explanation, etc.
      - Used as a focus marker → indicates that what follows is important
    - Often associated with young people - "Valley Girl" → also false
    - Multiple uses of like have been around for a century
- Linguistic Profiling - using the characteristics of a person's speech to identify them as a member of a particular group
  - Purnell, Idsardi, and Baugh - can you connect the way a person speaks and discrimination
    - Baugh found discrimination in landlord appointments when switching between SAE, AAVE, and Chicano English
    - The "hello" was clipped out of the introduction, the listener was able to identify the correct dialect 70% of the time
- Sign Languages
  - Diversity often goes unrecognized
  - 2-3 in 1000 babies born deaf, 2 million profoundly deaf people, 90% born to hearing parents, 100,000+ ASL users in US
  - Myth 1: Sign language is universal
    - There are many different sign languages (~300)
    - Mutually unintelligible
    - Different sign languages use different signs
    - There can be dialects of sign language
  - Myth 2: Sign language is iconic/just gestures
    - Some signs are iconic
    - Most signs are unguessable and are not iconic
    - If iconic, most signs would be similar across variations of sign language
      - Abstract concepts would be impossible to sign
  - Myth 3: Sign languages are encodings of spoken languages
    - Probably fostered by the existence of fingerspelling
      - Manual representation of the letters of a language, oftentimes if there is no sign for the word
  - Myth 4: Signed languages are just strings of hand motions
    - "Signed languages don't have grammar" → false
      - If this were true, you could sign whatever you want
      - 5 basic parameters: shape of the hand, place of articulation, movement, palm orientation, facial expression
    - Each signed language has a restricted set of hand shapes that can be used

## **10/14: Variation in Language**

- About Languages
  - We all have high-level grammatical insights without even being aware of it
  - These grammatical insights are described by linguists
  - Linguistics is the scientific field that scientifically studies language
  - Language is a cognitive faculty and can be expressed by speakers in multimodal dimensions
    - Sign languages - SLs provides some of the best evidence of a universal language device
  - We live in a multilingual world
    - Bilingualism/Multilingualism
    - Language diversity
    - Diglossia - same speaker using 2 languages in 2 distinct social occasions, one formal and the other informal
- Space/Place
  - Regional differences are something everybody acknowledges
  - There are differences at any level of language use
    - Ex) American vs. British English
  - Why do regional/local differences develop?
    - Different places/varieties established by people from different places, backgrounds, varieties
    - Barriers to interaction let each variety develop in its own way (or avoid changes that happen elsewhere)
    - Different varieties are in contact with different other languages or varieties
    - This is easier to understand by looking at an actual example:
      - Sardinian varieties are different from the rest of Italo-Romance varieties
        - Geographical barrier - island
      - Extreme south Italy varieties are different from the rest of the dialects spoken in the Peninsula
        - Long-standing contact with Greek-speaking people - Magna Graecia
- Time/Age
  - Languages vary in time
    - The same language shows remarkable differences based on the time of attestation
  - The way the speakers speak changes in a lifetime
  - What does it mean if two people speak differently?
    - Two different possibilities
      - Age grading
        - There are stable ways of talking based on our age
          - When today's younger people age, they'll adopt older generation way of speaking
        - These changes across the lifespan could be due to different changes in life (entering the workforce, etc.)
      - Apparent time hypothesis
        - People born in 1930 reflect a 1930s way of talking, people born in 1990 reflect a 1990s way
          - This assumes that the way we speak is more or less steady the same throughout our lives
        - Comparing generations lets us see change as it happens
        - What does this mean for linguistics? We can study change while it happens
- Variation and Change
  - Languages do not change quickly
    - We all use both old and new forms together for a while
    - Some of us use the old form, some use the new
  - So change over time is reflected in variation at any single time point
    - Not all variation is part of a change
    - Some variation is stable, sticks around for centuries
- Language Variation: Sign Languages
  - SLs
    - Fully developed human languages
    - Languages of deaf communities
    - Express meaning and convey grammatical features through a visual-gestural system (body, hands, facial gestures)
  - Universality confirmed!
    - Despite the different modality in which meaning and grammar are expressed, SLs confirm that language is a biological ability and a cognitive faculty acquire by all human beings
  - ASL varies from place to place
    - Two-handed vs. One-handed variants of the ASL cow based on southern region vs. other regions of the US
  - Change in time in BSL

## **10/15: Discussion 2**

- Linguistic Variation
  - People speak differently from each other
  - Basic question: Is one person's way of speaking better than everyone else's
    - If yes, how is this determined?
    - If no, why not?
  - Habitual/Invariant Be: African American Language
    - Used to describe an action that occurs regularly over time
      - Adverbs: often, usually, always
    - Does not give any indication of whether they are currently in the process of doing that thing
    - Cannot mean that something has just happened once
  - All dialects are equally rule-governed and equally correct, but one dialect is considered a prestige dialect while others are considered (by non-linguists) to be substandard
    - Prestige dialects are associated with positive attributes (education level, sophistication, etc.)
    - Other dialects are considered the opposite
- Popular Notions of Dialect
  - A dialect is a pseudo-language spoken by uneducated or country people
- What is a dialect?
  - A dialect refers to any variety of a language that is shared by a group of speakers
  - Everyone speaks a dialect
- Thinking about Variation
  - We have seen in the lectures that the dialects of AAVE and Singlish have grammar structures just like SAE
- Summary
  - Negative attitudes about non-standard speech are pervasive
  - We have seen these negative attitudes have no linguistic basis
  - Native speakers may be unaware of the grammar rules of non-standard speech

## **10/17: The Brain and Language**

- Where is language processed in the brain?
  - Are all aspects of language processed in the same part of the brain?
  - What happens to language when this part gets damaged?
- Physical structure of the brain
  - 2 hemispheres
  - 2 cells: neurons and glia
    - Neurons have a soma (body), dendrites (electrical impulses bring info through these), axon (electrical impulses go out of the cell)
  - Outer shell is called the cortex
    - Cortex composed of billions of neural cell bodies
    - Sometimes called gray matter
  - Corpus callosum
    - Bundle of axons/white matter that connects the 2 hemispheres and allows them to communicate
  - Contralateral control
    - Stimuli from one side of the body is sent to the opposite side of the brain
      - Presentation of the stimulus in the right visual field of both eyes is processed through the left hemisphere, crosses the corpus callosum, and is communicated to the right hemisphere
    - Plays an important role in our understanding of language/its location in the brain
- Early ideas on the brain → phrenology
  - Developed parts of the brain are bigger and create bumps in your skull
  - Pseudoscience
  - Introduced the idea of locality in the brain
    - Left hemisphere
      - Written and spoken language
      - Dichotic listening
        - Simultaneously play 2 distinct sounds → subjects only report hearing one sound → almost always the right ear
        - This sound is the sound presented to the left hemisphere → suggests strong left hemisphere preference
      - Split brain patients
        - Patients with severed corpus callosum → hemispheres cannot communicate with each other
        - Words/images flashed into the left/right visual field
        - Correct reporting of what is seen in the right visual field
        - Cannot report what is seen in the left visual field → could still draw what they saw → linguistic response unavailable
        - Very strong evidence that language is lateralized to the left hemisphere
      - Wada Test
        - Anesthetizes one hemisphere of the patient's brain
        - Ask patient to identify an object in their left hand
          - No response when left hemisphere is anesthetized
            - Could still identify the object
          - Linguistic responses possible when the right hemisphere is anesthetized
      - Brain imaging techniques
        - We can look at healthy brains to see what's going on
        - FMRI - Function Magnetic Resonance Imaging
          - A giant electromagnet
          - Can measure changes in magnetic properties in the brain
          - Activated neurons use more oxygenated blood → magnetic properties different between oxygenated and deoxygenated
            - Have the patient perform certain tasks to see which areas of the brain respond
            - Measure the patient's base signal and their signal when they're performing the task
- Language Areas in Left Hemisphere
  - Broca's Area
    - Observed Tan's brain → lesion in the local area, connected to linguistic disability
    - Damage to this part is called Broca's Aphasia
      - Speech is broken and halted - telegraphic speech
      - Words make some sense, but structure is incorrect → semantics are ok, syntax is not
      - "Agrammatic aphasia"
      - Good comprehension of simple sentences, poor comprehension of complex sentences
      - Writing ability
        - Few words, but they make sense
  - Wernicke's Area
    - Observed language deficits that didn't involve Broca's Area
    - Identified damage association in the temporal lobe
    - Damage to this part is called Wernicke's Aphasia
      - Speech is fluent, but doesn't make much sense
      - Grammar is not usually affected
      - Problems with word choice and meaning → semantics off, syntax is ok
      - Comprehension severely impaired
      - "Semantic aphasia"
      - Writing ability
        - A lot of words, but they don't make sense
  - Aphasia
    - A disruption of linguistic ability due to brain damage
    - Language isn't just housed in a simple box in the brain
      - It's localized to specific areas in the left hemisphere
- Sign Languages
  - Neuroimaging sign languages
    - Looked at hearing English speakers, hearing BSL signers, and deaf BSL signers
      - English speakers saw Broca's and Wernicke's lighting up
      - Hearing BSL signers saw Broca's and Wernicke's lighting up
      - Deaf BSL signers saw Broca's and Wernicke's lighting up
        - All groups pattern more or less the same for both hemispheres
  - Even though spoken languages and signed languages use different modalities, they're both processed as language in the brain
- Are language abilities related to general intelligence?
  - People often associate language ability with intelligence
    - If this is true, what should we find?
      - Low IQ → poor language ability
      - High IQ → high language ability
  - Specific Language Impairment (SLI)
    - Affects ~7-8% of kindergarten age children
    - Deals with very specific types of difficulty in grammar
      - Functional words, tense, plurality, etc.
    - May start speaking late and be hard to understand
    - Thee children have normal IQ and have equal cognitive ability in other areas
      - Only linguistic ability is affected
    - Doesn't agree with hypothesis, expected correlation doesn't hold
  - Williams Syndrome
    - If language is separate, we should find high language skills but low IQ cases
    - Overall IQ: 40-90
    - Limited spatial and motor skills
    - Extremely social and friendly
    - High level of vocabulary and grammar
    - Better than average facial recognition
    - Often love music
    - Result of deletion of one copy of approx. 20 contiguous genes on chromosome 7
  - Linguistic savants
    - People who have low general intelligence, but very high language intelligence
    - Another case of dissociation between language ability and IQ

## **10/21: Biological Linguistics**

- How do we know that language is a biologically-determined ability?
- Language development and age/time
  - Language involves a critical period of language acquisition
    - A span of time after which complete acquisition is difficult or impossible
    - "Window of opportunity"
  - Critical period is widely documented, not only for our species
- Types of critical period in other species: acquisition of songs by birds
  - Young birds reared away from their species fail to acquire the song
  - Even when returning to their original habitat
  - If chaffinches isolated during 4th month, they do not acquire the birdsong of its species
    - Hearing the song before or after: useless
    - They need direct trigger during specific period
- Types of critical period in other species: kittens
  - Sight development in kittens
    - One eye temporarily closed when young
    - Fail to "wire up" their natural circuitry for that eye
    - Do not make up for that deficit later
- Types of critical period in other species: chickens
  - Pecking behavior triggered by exposure to light during the first 2 weeks of life
  - Chickens raised in the dark and fed with droppers for 2 weeks will not learn how to peck
- Experiments on humans? No
  - Humans cannot be directly tested the same way
  - Cases of lunatic or criminal behavior by parents
    - Well-studied case - Genie
  - Accidental situations (illness) have occasionally created such situations
    - Chelsea
      - Profoundly deaf from birth
      - Came from a loving home
      - Initially misdiagnosed as being intellectually disabled
      - Started learning language at age 32 when she was correctly diagnosed
      - Developed a fairly good lexicon
      - Syntax was broken
      - Some functional items present, but totally unprincipled
    - E. M.
      - Profoundly deaf from birth
      - No contact with the deaf community
      - Hearing aids at 15 years
      - Normal IQ, cognitively functional
      - Severe deficiencies in verbal comprehension and production
        - After 4 years trying to learn Spanish
- Language is a biologically-based ability
  - E. Lenneberg (1967)
    - Hypothesized a critical period for language development
    - Biologically-determined ability
      - Language = walking upright
    - Critical period - period of time when the brain is undergoing a process of lateralization
      - Brain is divided into 2 parts
  - Lennenberg's Hypothesis: based on studies of recovery after aphasia
    - Children recover well, but adults do not
  - Maturational constraint on language acquisition
    - Issue of maturational changes in brain plasticity
      - Time affects brain plasticity
  - Different account: neural commitment hypothesis
    - During language acquisition, brain adapts to the structure of L1(s)
    - Language exposure tunes the system to select the useful input
    - Neurons become committed to encoding linguistically relevant properties of L1
    - Neurons cannot be recommitted upon L2 exposure
- What is an L2?
  - Natural language acquired after the L1
    - When the critical age of L1 acquisition is closed
  - L1 vs. L2 = acquisition differences
    - Not performance differences - L1 does not always correspond to the language in which an L2er is more proficient
- Comparing L1 and L2 acquisition
  - Is 2nd language acquisition in adults like first language acquisition in children
  - L1 and L2 acquisition are generally different
    - They start out differently
    - Clear-cut distinction: native language or not?
  - L1 and L2 acquisition are also comparable
    - L2ers like L1ers are creative in the process of language acquisition
    - L2ers construct grammars too
  - Fundamental Differences hypothesis
    - L1 and L2 adult acquisition - fundamentally different processes
      - L1 acquisition
        - A biologically-driven program specific to language
        - Uniformity, absence of error, speed and ease of acquisition
      - L2 acquisition
        - Adults use general problem solving skills
        - Learning process is goal-oriented, uses feedback and direct instruction
  - The role of the learning context
    - Positive influence of naturalistic exposure on L2 sociolinguistic development
    - Effects of context of acquisition exerts a significant effect on multilinguals later pragmatic use of language
    - Languages learned only in a formal context
      - Use of L2 mostly in a formal context → lack of socio-pragmatic competence

## **10/22: Discussion 3**

- Brain and Language
  - Localization of language in the brain
  - Aphasias
  - Intelligence
- Lateralization
  - What evidence do we have to say that language is processed in the left hemisphere?
- Dichotic Listening
  - What happens in a dichotic listening experiment?
    - Different sounds are played simultaneously to different ears
    - People almost always report the sound played to the right ear
  - Music is processed in the right hemisphere
    - In the dichotic listening test, subjects report hearing music in the left ear
- Wada Test
  - One hemisphere of a patient's brain is temporarily put to sleep
  - The patient is then asked to count numbers, identify objects, and answer questions
  - Left brain asleep?
    - Subject unable to produce language
    - Can identify picture of object
      - Left hemisphere is capable of subconscious language activity
- Split Brain
  - Corpus callosum severed - no communication between hemispheres
  - Based on contralateral nature of brain organization
- Two Types of Aphasia
  - Broca's Aphasia
    - Broken syntax
    - Semantically coherent
    - Relatively good comprehension, can understand simple sentences but not complex sentences
  - Wernicke's Aphasia
    - Patient can produce fluent sentences
    - Utterance doesn't make sense in meaning
    - Grammar usually not affected
    - Problem w/ word voice
    - Comprehension severely impaired
    - Semantic aphasia
- Sign Languages
  - Sign languages activate the same brain centers as normal language
  - Sign language uses visual-spatial cues
    - Usually processed in right hemisphere
    - Sign language processed in left hemisphere
- Language and Intelligence
  - People oftentimes associate language ability with general intelligence
    - Specific Language Impairment (SLI)
      - Very specific types of difficult with language, omission of function or grammatical words
      - Fall in the typical IQ range, normal ability in all other areas like speech comprehension and hearing
    - Williams Syndrome
      - Avg. IQ: 55
      - Limited spatial and motor skills
      - Extremely social and friendly
      - Typically have strong affinity for music
      - May have exceptional sense of rhythm, be moved emotionally by music
    - Linguistic Savants
  - Language is not tied up with general intelligence
    - Develops separately from other aspects of intelligence
- Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis
  - When we learn a new language, does our way of thinking change?
  - Wilhelm von Humboldt argued that certain language types are more adequate for thought and civilization
  - Whorf proposed a specific mechanism for how language influences thought

    - Speaker interpretation → language-specific meanings
    - Language suggests associations not entailed by experience
  - Formulations

## **10/24: Phonetics**

- Phonetics is how speech sounds are produced, transmitted, and perceived
  - We're going to focus on their production
- When you know the phonetics of your language, what do you know?
  - The phonetic inventory - the set of sounds in the language
    - SAE includes subsets of consonants and vowels
    - Doesn't include other types of sounds
  - What do you know when you know the phonetic inventory of a language?
    - You know how to separate a continuous stream of speech into distinct words and a word into distinct sounds
- Vocal tract
  - Structures that work together to produce speech sounds
  - The way we pronounce vowels and consonants is directly related to this structure
  - Alveolar ridge
  - Hard palate
  - Soft palate/velum
  - Uvula
  - Pharynx
  - Glottis
- Spelling
  - Why do we need to use articulators to define sounds?
    - Why can't we rely on orthography/spelling?
    - Spelling is full of inconsistencies when it comes to sounds
  - Orthography
    - Phonetics != spelling → same symbols make different sounds/same sounds made by different symbols/symbols that aren't pronounced
  - International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
    - Why use the IPA?
      - Each symbol has a one to one correspondence with a sound
      - It can be used to represent any human language
      - IPA symbols enclosed in square brackets
        - phone = `[fon]`
    - Consonants vs. vowels
      - Sounds of language fall into these 2 classes → different kinds of sound
      - Consonants:
        - Produced with some closure in the vocal tract that impedes the flow of air from the lungs
        - Place of articulation - where is the consonant produced?
          - Articulation - part of the mouth touches or interacts with another area of the vocal tract → 7 places of articulation
            - Bilabials - `[p]`, `[b]`, `[m]` → sounds produced by bringing both lips together
            - Labiodentals - `[f]`, `[v]` → bottom lip to the upper teeth
            - Interdentals - thigh, thus → sounds produce by inserting the tip of the tongue between the upper teeth and the lower teeth
            - Alveolars - `[t]`, `[d]`, `[n]`, `[s]`, `[z]`, `[l]`, `[r]` → sounds produced by raising the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge
            - Palatals - mission, measure, cheap, judge, you → sound produced by raising the front part of the tongue to the hard palate
            - Velars - `[k]`, `[g]`, `[n]` → sounds produced by raising the back of the tongue to the soft palate or velum
            - Glottals - `[h]`, `[?]` → produced with the flow of air through the open glottis
              - uh-oh - `[?]` → produced when air is stopped completely at the glottis - glottal stop
            - Labio-velar - `[w]` → sounds produced by a combination of pursed lips and raising the back of the tongue to the velum
        - Voicing - are the vocal folds vibrating (voiced) or not (voiceless-open glottis)
          - Pie vs. Buy
          - Tie vs. Die
          - Cap vs. Gap
          - Voiceless vs. Voiced
            - Voiceless - vocal folds/cords are apart, air flows freely through the glottis - `[s]`
            - Voiced - vocal folds.cords are together, air forces through, causing vibrations - `[z]`
        - Manner of articulation - how is the consonant produced?
          - Stops - there is a complete obstruction of airflow somewhere in the vocal tract
            - Oral stops
              - The velum is raised to block the nasal cavity so that when the stop is released, the air flows out through the mouth
            - Nasal stops
              - The velum is lowered to open the nasal cavity
            - Aspiration - a brief puff of air that escapes after the stop is released and before the vocal cords begin vibrating
              - `[p^h]`
              - Voiceless oral stops are aspirated in word-initial position
          - Fricatives - major, but not complete, obstruction in the vocal tract
            - The opening through which the air escapes is small, so a turbulent noise is produced as a result
            - `[f]`, `[v]`, `[theta]`, etc.
            - The articulators are really close, so there is a lot of friction in a small space
          - Affricates - made by briefly stopping airflow completely, then slightly releasing closure so that a fricative-like noise is made
            - Stop quickly followed by a fricative
          - Liquids - some minor obstruction of airflow, but air still passes through
            - `[l]`, `[r]`
            - `[l]` is a lateral liquid
              - Air flows on the sides of the tongue
            - `[r]` is a retroflex liquid
              - Tongue is curled back behind the alveolar ridge
          - Glides - very small obstruction of airflow, articulators move closer together, but not by much
            - `[j]` - palatal glide
            - `[w]` - labio-velar glide
          - Trilled `[r]` - Indian English, not present in American English
            - One articulator touches another in a very rapid-fire, repeating motion
            - Dialects of the same language differ by their phonetic inventories
            - Knowledge of your native language includes knowing what's in your phonetic inventory
      - Vowels:
        - Tongue position - front, center, or back?
        - Tongue height - high, mid, or low?
          - High - beet, bit, boot, book
          - Mid - bait, bet, about, but, boat, bought
          - Low - bat, cot
        - Tenseness - is your tongue tense or lax?
          - Tense - muscles tensed and mouth is relatively narrower, slightly higher and longer than lax vowels
        - Lip rounding - are your lips rounded or not?
          - 4 rounded vowels
          - 8 unrounded
          - Cot-caught merger → [upside-down c] and [a] merge
          - By itself, lip rounding makes no distinctions between vowels
        - Diphthong - combinations of two vowels
          - At least 3 in English
          - eye, boy, house → combine a vowel and a glide
      - Natural Classes:
        - Groups of sounds that can be identities by sharing particular features
        - Helps us understand differences between dialects
          - Ex) Canadian Raising → happens before voiceless consonants
      - Transcription - rendering a word in IPA
        - Can be more sounds in a word than there are letters
        - Other times there are far fewer sounds than letters
        - Letters and sounds have a disconnect
      - Reverse Transcription - IPA → English
      - Syllabic Sounds
        - Every language has rules about which sounds can function as the center of a syllable
        - Syllable nuclei in English - almost always vowels, but occasionally we allow liquids and nasals to act as the nucleus
        - Marked with diacritics
        - Can also be represented with a schwa + the letter
- William Labov in NYC
  - Systematic variation in `[r]` pronunciation based on social class, attention paid to speech, linguistic context of a variant
  - NYE has a dropped `[r]` → word-final position and when the `[r]` sound precedes another constant
  - Pronunciation of `[r]` is prestigious
  - Dropping of `[r]` is perceived as nonstandard speech
  - Went to 3 classes of stores and asked for sale on the fourth floor
    - 2 kinds each → casual and careful articulation
    - 2 environments of `[r]` sound
      - Floor `[r]` pronounced 63%, 44%, 8% from high society → low
        - Second attempt: 64%, 61%, 18% → marker of the speech of people lower on the socio-economic ladder
  - Separate study looked at realization of `[r]` before a constant
    - Looked at realization in casual speech, formal speech, reading style, word lists
    - Follows results of shopping center study
- Received Pronunciation (RP)
  - Prestige dialect → `[r]`-less dialect
  - Disconnect between social classes in British English and NYE
  - Studied by Peter Trudgill in Reading, England
    - Direct relationship found, direct opposite from NYE study
  - Phonetic markers of social class are arbitrary
    - Prestige or lack of prestige associated with particular phonetic markers is not random
      - More marginalized speakers = more marginalized speech forms
      - Can see how attitudes towards non-standard dialects are shaped
- Phonology - how speech sounds are organized in different languages
  - Phonology is the linguistic knowledge a speaker has of the sound patterns that are possible in a language
    - Pan - alveolar nasal end `n`
    - Pancake - velar nasal end `n` → `n` precedes velar nasal `c`
    - Pan bread - bilabial nasal end `n` → precedes a bilabial stop `b`
  - `[t^h jun]` vs. `[t^h un]`
    - American English prohibits certain combinations of sounds in word initial
    - position
      - Yod is dropped when it follows word-initial alveolar sounds
  - What is the organization of sounds in a given language?
  - Which sounds are predictable and which are unpredictable based on the environment?
  - What are the phonetic contexts which allows us to predict the appearance or disappearance of these qualities?
- Sign Language
  - To what extent are signed languages like spoken languages?
  - Can we find phonetics in sign language?
  - Differ in the handshapes that are permissible
  - In spoken language the individual sounds in a word are meaningless
    - Similar to how the individual handshapes in ASL are meaningless
  - When we think about sounds in language, we can characterize them in terms of features
    - We can do the same with handshapes
      - Parameters (or primes) - discrete units of a sign
        - Handshape
        - Place of articulation
        - Movement
        - Palm orientation

## **10/28: Linguistic Change**

- Case of Martha's Vineyard
  - Island in the US East coast
  - Shift in the phonetic position of the first elements of the diphthongs `/ai/` and `/au/`
    - Studied the frequency and distribution of phonetic variants in:
      - Several areas
      - Different age groups
      - Different occupational groups
      - Different ethnic groups
  - Island speech was characterized by the mild centralization of the first element of `/ai/` in words such as wife, night, right, etc.
  - Little to no centralization of the first element of /au/ in house, out, about, etc.
    - Centralization means a goes from low to mid schwa
  - Demographics in the early 60s:
    - Permanent pop. - 6000
      - Consisted of Yankees (descendants of early settlers), Portuguese (more recent arrivals), and Native Americans + misc. group (15%)
    - Big influx of visitors in summer - 40,000
    - Eastern part of island - "Down Island"
      - More densely populated and favored by visitors
    - Western part of island - "Up Island"
      - More original inhabitants and strictly rural
    - Chilmark: center of once important fishing industry (~2.5% of ppl.)
      - Chilmark fishermen antipathetic to the summer people
      - Chilmark fisherman regarded by other islanders as independent, skillful, physically strong, courageous
  - Labov's Study
    - Face to face interviews with 69 informants
      - Lexical questionnaire
      - Questions about value judgements (to explore the social orientation of the speaker) and elicit as many diphthongs as possible
    - Recordings of school pupils reading texts
    - Recordings in very casual situations (bars, stores, etc.)
  - Initial results:
    - Plotted use of centralized vowel against various parameters
      - Age, pop. group, occupation, location
    - Summary:
      - Centralization of diphthongs most prevalent in
        - Age: 31-45
        - Origin: Yankees, only by a little
        - Occupation: Fisherman mostly, less in people working in tourism
        - Location: Up Island residents, esp. around Chilmark
  - Explanation:
    - Centralizing tendency was actually diminishing in the 1930s
    - Remained in dialect of middle-aged rural fisherman
    - With the advent of tourists, there was an unconscious change among those who most closely identified with the island
    - Expression of strong resistance to the incursions of the summer people
- Significance?
  - Until Labov, dialect studies had focused on rural speakers and had ignored social factors
  - Urban accents were thought to be too adverse and to heterogenous to study
  - Labov's conclusion: social factors were in fact the most significant and important

## **10/29: Discussion 4**

- Consonants
  - Place of articulation: where is the constant produced
    - Bilabials - bringing both lips together
    - Labiodentals - touching the bottom lip to the upper teeth
    - Interdental - inserting the tip of the tongue between the teeth
    - Alveolars - tongue raised in various ways to the alveolar ridge
    - Palatals - raising the front part of the tongue to the palate
    - Velars - raising the back of the tongue to the velum/soft palate
    - Uvulars - raising the back of the tongue to the uvula
      - Sounds do not ordinarily occur in English
    - Glottals
      - Glottal stop (uh-oh)
  - Voicing: are the vocal folds vibrating
    - Voiceless - vocal cords are apart so that air flows freely through the glottis
    - Voicing - vocal cords ae together so that the glottis vibrates
  - Manner of articulation: degree of constriction in the vocal tract
    - Stops - consonants in which the airstream is completely blocked in the oral cavity for a short period of time and the velum is raised so that no air can escape from the nasal cavity
    - Nasal stops - consonants in which the airstream is completely blocked in the oral cavity for a short period of time and the velum is lowered so that air can escape from the nasal cavity
    - Fricative - airflow is so severely obstructed that it causes friction
    - Affricates - these sounds are produced by a stop closure followed immediately by a gradual release in closure
    - Liquid - there is some obstruction of the airstream in the mouth, but not enough to cause any real constriction or friction
    - Glides - produced with little obstruction of the airstream
- Vowels
  - Tongue position - front, central, back
  - Tenseness - tense, lax
  - Tongue height - high, mid, low
  - Roundness - rounded, unrounded

## **11/2: Morphology**

- Morphology is the study of words - their structure, function, and distribution
  - Goal is to understand how words are represented in the mind of the speaker
- Knowledge of words
  - What do we know when we know a word?
    - The arbitrary sounds associated with a word
    - The word's meaning
    - The word's syntactic category
      - Syntactic categories will be important when we talk about word and sentence formation
  - What do we not know?
    - We might not know how a word is written
    - We may or may not know the etymology of the word
  - Lexicon - our own personal store of words
    - Every word we know has a lexical entry
    - Our mental dictionary includes all the words we know and everything associated with those words
    - Difference between physical dictionaries?
      - Physical dictionary contains many words we don't know
      - Printed dictionaries often don't contain words that speakers use
- Looking inside words
  - Morphemes - the smallest linguistic unit that has meaning
    - A morpheme is not equivalent to a word
    - All words consist of at least one morpheme
    - Discreteness of language - each morpheme is a discrete unit of meaning, which we can manipulate
    - We can combine morphemes to create words
    - We can decompose words into their morphemes
    - Property of all human knowledges
    - Free vs. Bound
      - Free morpheme - a morpheme that can stand alone as a free word
        - 2 types:
          - Content/lexical - most nouns, verbs, and adverbs → open class, we can add more to create new content words
          - Functional - serve some grammatical purpose
            - he, she, it, a, the, etc.
            - Closed class, we can't usually create new words in them
        - Lexical vs. Functional
          - Broca's aphasia patients leave many functional morphemes out of their speech
            - Leaves lexical morphemes alone
            - Selective in impairment
      - Bound morpheme - must be attached to a free morpheme
        - `-ed`, `-ing`, `-s`, `pre-`, `re-`, `un-`
        - 2 types:
          - Inflectional - grammatical, they affect the grammar of the word they attach to
            - Do not typically change the category of a word
            - 8: `-s`, (3rd person singular present, plural, possessive), `-ed`, `-ing`, `-en`/`ed`, `-er`, `-est`
            - Attach to a particular category of word → can attach to almost any word of the particular category
            - Refine meaning, don't change the core meaning
          - Derivational - help to derive new word categories
            - Often change the part of speech
            - Usually not as productive as inflectional morphemes
    - We can transform words into something else all the time, but we know what's ok and what's not → allows us to create novel words
    - Words have structure and morphemes are the building blocks → creative, yet structured
    - Affixes combining
      - Certain affixes attach to certain kinds of words
    - Word trees:
      - Runner → run `-er`
      - Greasy → grease `-y`
      - Create a roadmap of how to build a word
      - Only combine in a particular order and only with specific categories of other morphemes
      - Be careful of ambiguous words
      - Unlockable
  - Affixation
    - One process which we use to build new words
    - We can adapt the meaning of a word by piling more affixes onto it
    - Affix - any morpheme that attaches to a root (bound morpheme)
      - Suffix - affixes that attach after the root
      - English causatives - `-en` → derivational suffix
    - New bound morpheme? `-ass`
      - Acts as an intensifier → bound morpheme
  - Infixation
    - Infix - an affix that attaches inside the root
    - Expletive infixation
    - Iz infixation
    - Homeric infixation
  - Circumfixation
    - Circumfix - affixes that surround the root both initially and finally
- Morphological Analysis
  - Case Study: Kanuri
    - Chadic language of Nigeria
    - `n[schwa]m-` is the morpheme that derives nouns from adjectives
  - The absence of an affix can be significant
  - Null symbol identifies an unmarked morpheme
  - The English plural morpheme
    - `[s]`, `[z]`, `[Iz]` are allomorphs of the plural morpheme
    - Wug Testing
    - `[s]` - voiceless
    - `[z]` - voiced
    - `[Iz]` - sibilants
- Inflection
  - Inflection morphemes are purely grammatical - tense, number, gender, case, etc.
  - Often very productive
  - Typically come after derivational morphemes in a word
  - Can perform a great number of things
  - English doesn't make great use of this property - case marking
- Word Formation
  - Affixation, prefixation, suffixation, infixation, circumfixation
  - Reduplication - forming new words by duplicating part or all of an existing word
    - Contrastive Focus Reduplication
      - "We're not living together-living together"
      - Puts focus on the most prototypical, stereotypical example of something
    - Singlish
      - Makes extensive use of reduplication
      - Allows for reduplication of nouns, adjectives and verbs
      - Adds a closeness aspect to it
      - Constrained by one syllable for proper names
      - Adjectival reduplication
        - Plain adjective and comparatives can be replicated
        - Superlatives cannot be
      - Verb reduplication
        - Reduplicating once - to do something a little bit
        - Replicating twice - continuous action

## **11/4: Morphological and Syntactic Variation**

- Reduplication in Italo-Romance
  - The case of the formation of superlatives
  - At least 3 ways of expressing the superlative degree of an adjective
    - One is a pure morphological derivation: `-issim-` suffix
      - SID lacks this superlative formation method
- Variation in Syntax: Comparing Latin American Spanish and Iberian Spanish
  - Majority of Spanish speakers who exported Spanish in Latin American came from the Andalusia
    - Many dialects of Latin American Spanish share a variety of features with Andalusian varieties
  - Word and syllable final `/s/` > `[h]`
    - Aspiration of /s/ when placed at the end of a syllable
    - Iberian Spanish `[s]` is pronounced
    - Latin American Spanish `[s]` → `[h]`
    - Andalusian Spanish
      - `/s/` can be deleted
      - Possible morphological consequences
  - Points of Difference
    - Phonetics, morphology, syntax, lexis
    - LAmSp weak pronouns can be reduplicated

## **11/5: Discussion 5**

- Types of morphemes
  - Free: lexical and functional
    - Lexical morphemes form an open class → we can coin new words from the available morphemes
    - Functional morphemes form a closed class → we cannot coin or create new items from this class
      - Prepositions
      - Pronouns
      - Conjunctions
      - Determiners - a, an, the, etc.
  - Bound: derivational and inflectional
    - Derivational - can changes the syntactic category of the word they attach to
    - Inflectional morphemes never change the category of the root word

## **11/12: Syntax**

- Syntax is the study of how phases and sentences are constructed
- There are a lot of similarities between word construction and sentence construction
- 2 approaches
  - Ordered linearly - no hierarchy
  - Words have internal structure, grouped into constituents
  - Words are not linear in a sentence
- Constituents
  - Words are grouped into units called constituents
  - Sometimes more than one grouping is possible
  - Infinitely extended length
  - Word order is constrained
    - Known when we know a language
    - Basic word order varies greatly across languages
      - English - subject - verb - object
    - Matters in meaningless sentences
      - Disassociate syntax and meaning - "colorless green ideas sleep furiously"
  - Similar building blocks across languages
    - Same syntactic categories - nouns and verbs, maybe adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, articles, prepositions, etc.
  - Determining constituency
    - Even though we have not been taught, we have intuitions about what counts as a consistent or a unit of the syntax
    - This kind of knowledge is part of native speakers' knowledge of language
    - There are a number of linguistic tests that we can use to test whether or not a given string of words is a constituent
      - Perform multiple tests - 1 failed test is not enough to give up
      - Every sentence/word is a constituent
- Syntactic categories
  - Traditional approach is to determine syntactic categories by looking at meaning
  - Behavioral approach
    - A word is what it does
    - Determine a word's syntactic category by how it behaves, not what it means
  - Nouns - follows a definite article, indefinite article, numeral, which phrase, or a possessor
    - The book, a book, six books, which book, Mary's book
  - Verbs - a word that can combine with the tense suffixes
    - Wiped, wipes
  - Adjectives - an item that can appear in the position following seem/seems
    - He seems happy
    - If `-er` or `-est` can be added to the word, or the word can follow more or most
      - Happier, happiest, more promising, the most promising
- Constituency Tests
  - Replacement test:
    - There are 2 types of replacement
      - Pronoun replacement test - many constituents can be replaced by pronouns
        - The resulting sentence must be grammatical and have the same meaning
        - I found the puppy at the park → I found him at the park
          - The puppy is a constituent
      - Do so/do too replacement test
        - Can the string of words be replaced by do so or do too → verb phrases
        - Must maintain the original meaning
        - The old man found a dollar → The old man did so
          - Found a dollar is a constituent
  - Stand-alone test
    - A chunk of words that can stand on its own as an answer to a question is a constituent
  - Movement test
    - When a group of words can be moved around within a sentence, it's a constituent by definition
      - Fronting - moving a group of words to the beginning of a sentence → grammatical + same basic meaning = constituent
      - Clefting - breaking up a sentence and feeding it into the formula: it is/was _____ that ______.
- Constituency tests to trees
  - All English sentences must contain (minimally) a noun and a verb
    - Noun phrase and a verb phrase
  - Phrase structure rules
    - `S → NP VP`
      - A sentence must contain a noun phrase and a verb phrase
    - `NP → (DET) (Adj) N (PP)`
      - Noun phrases have an optional determiner, optional adjective, mandatory noun, and optional prepositional phrase
      - `NP`s are interchangeable in sentences, you can replace an `NP` with another `NP`
      - Targeted by pronoun replacement
    - `VP → V (NP) (PP) (Adv)`
      - Verb phrases have a mandatory verb, optional noun phrase, optional prepositional phrase, and optional adverb
      - `VP`s can be inserted into a sentence in a position which requires a verb
      - Do so/do too targets `VP`s
    - `PP → Prep (NP)`
      - Prepositional phrases have a mandatory preposition and an optional noun phrase
- Phrase structure trees
  - Syntactic trees allow us to see.encode the constituency of a sentence directly
  - When we use trees, we must do 2 things:
    - Accurately represent word order
    - Identify constituents
  - Are like blueprints for a sentence
    - Show us how sentences are built
    - How they can be broken down into pieces
  - Where do these trees.constituent structures come from?
  - How do speakers correctly structure their utterances?
  - Leading hypothesis: speakers appeal to unconscious/internalized phrase structure rules
  - Part of knowledge of native language - you know phrase structure rules that enable you to make hierarchy constituent structures effortlessly
  - Terminology:
    - Node - a labeled branch point, where the syntactic category is labelled
    - Domination - every higher node dominates all the categories beneath it
    - Sisters - 2 categories that are directly under the same node
    - Head - the lexical item which determines its syntactic category
      - Head of a `NP` is always a noun, head of a `VP` is always a verb
    - Complement - gives additional info about the head
      - Will be a sister of the head
      - Every category can have a complement
      - The complement may be another phrase with another head inside of it
- Crosslinguistic differences
  - English - head precedes the complement, Japanese - complement precedes the head
    - Japanese - phrase structure: `VP → NP V`
- Structural ambiguity
  - Sometimes the meaning of sentence is straightforward
    - Sometimes may have multiple interpretations
  - Lexical ambiguity
    - A single word may have multiple meanings
  - Word structure ambiguity
  - Syntactic structure ambiguity
- Habitual be in AAVE
- Multiple modals in Southern US English
- Syntactic processes
  - Subject auxiliary inversion - inversion of subject and auxiliary verb positions
    - Appears in AAVE → negative inversion
    - Wh-questions - wh-words end up at the front of the sentence
    - Conditional inversion - if...then clauses
    - Varies based on the English dialect → use in different contexts

## **11/12: Language Acquisition**

- How do children acquire their first language?
  - Who's the teacher?
    - Direct instruction doesn't work, much of the knowledge is subconscious
    - Acquisition happens effortlessly
  - What is the input data?
    - Adults only utter grammatical sentences → positive evidence
    - Ambient linguistic data available to children does not include ungrammatical sentences → negative evidence
    - Only input available to children is positive evidence
    - Children can distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical
  - How do children interpret novel data?
    - Children are only exposed to a finite number of sentences
    - However, they eventually acquire the ability to generate and understand an infinite number of sentences
  - What errors do children make?
    - They speak differently from adults
    - Pattern of their errors seems to be selective or limited
    - They would not make certain errors that would be overgeneralized from what they hear in adult speech
    - Regular vs. irregular verbs
      - Regular → `-ed`
      - Irregular → no `-ed`
      - Overgeneralized by children
    - Auxiliary verbs
      - Not overgeneralized with `-ed`
  - 4 facts: no instruction is involved, no negative evidence, finite input leads to infinite productivity, non-adult-like errors → Logical Problem of Language Acquisition
    - "Poverty of the Stimulus" → input from the child's linguistic environment doesn't seem to be enough to produce fluent speech
- Theory of Imitation - children imitate the adults around them in certain situation
  - Overgeneralizations tells us this theory is wrong
  - Children make errors that adults don't make
- Theory of Correction/Reinforcement - children learning is based on correction of bad sentences + positive reinforcement for correct speech
  - There seems to be no systematic positive or negative reinforcement from adults
    - Approval expressed after 45% of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences
  - Theory bad
  - Piedmont/Inuit/K'iche'/Mohawk
- Theory of Innateness
  - Model of innateness: developed with primary focus of addressing PoS
  - Language knowledge is innately specified
  - Richly structured
  - Innate knowledge of a language is called UG, blueprint for language
  - If language is innate, why do people come to acquire various different languages as their first languages?
    - UG component (categories of linguistic expressions, structured sentences and phrases) + specific properties (nouns/verbs/subjects/objects representation in the language, sentence structure)
    - UG is like the seed of a grammar of any language
  - UG is like the OS of a computer, variations of language are software → must fit with the OS
- What is acquired?
  - Word order acquisition
  - Phonetic and phonological acquisition
- What is acquisition driven by?
  - Example suggests language acquisition does not seem to be driven by imitation, correction, or reinforcement
  - Children's knowledge of language is complex and shows subtle implicit knowledge of rules
  - Since we are not overly taught these things, the claim is that this knowledge is hard-wired into the human genome
  - UG therefore facilitates first language acquisition, which explains why children develop language so effortlessly, rapidly, and uniformly across species
- Critical Period Hypothesis
  - Chaffinches acquiring song
  - Kittens and vertical/horizontal sight
  - Goslings and moving objects
  - Environmental input required during critical period for development
  - Birth → onset of puberty
  - Victor
    - Language progress was generally poor after 5 years of training
  - Genie
    - Learned how to communicate a message, acquire vocabulary
    - Could not use grammatical morphemes, use complex syntax structures
    - Showed language processing in the right hemisphere
    - Unclear if related to abuse
  - Chelsea
    - Deaf, misdiagnosed as mentally retarded until 31
    - Raised in loving and supportive environment
    - Developed a 2000+ word vocabulary
    - Able to hold a job, read, and write
    - Unable to acquire simple word order or complex syntax
  - Acquisition of ASL
    - Deaf children whose parents don;t sign
    - Normal early childhood, except for lack of language input
    - Early exposure are far superior in signing than later learners
    - Compared 3 groups:
      - Native signers
      - Early learners
      - Delayed learners
      - Native → early → delayed
      - All signers had been signing for 20 years
- Second language acquisition
  - Age of arrival is a better predictor of accent than number of years speaking
- Childhood Aphasia
  - Recovery is faster and much better
  - Right hemisphere can step in and take over if needed
  - 0-3 months - no effect
  - 21-36 months - language accomplishments disappear, re-acquire all stages
  - 3-10 years - aphasic symptoms, tendency for full recovery
  - 11+ years - aphasic symptoms persist
  - Lateralization tied to the critical period

## **11/22: Language Contact**

- Language contact occurs when 2 or more languages or dialects come into extended contact with each other
- Languages and speakers do not exist in isolation, but in social settings
- When we talk about language contact, we're talking about human contact
- Outcomes
  - What happens when cultures with multiple different languages come into extended contact?
  - Widespread bilingualism/codeswitching
  - Selection of a lingua franca - any language used to enable communication between groups of people with differing native languages
  - Language creations - pidgins and creoles
  - Language shift/endangerment and language death
  - Borrowing
    - Extremely common and need not be the result of extended contact between languages
    - Words, phonetics, morphology, syntax
- Language contact occurs in situations where groups of speakers of different languages come into contact with one another through
  - Geography
  - Conquest/war
  - Trade
- Terminology
  - Adstrates - languages in contact that equal prestige
  - Superstrate - language of dominant group
  - Lexifier language - the input language that provided most of the basic vocabulary or lexicon
  - Substrate - language of the less dominant group
    - Typically provides most of the phonological and grammatical features
- Pidgins and creoles
  - Speakers of mutually unintelligible languages are often brought together, perhaps through economic, political, or social factor
  - In order to communicate, they need to overcome the lack of a common language
  - Pidgin language - simplified language used in specific interactions such as business, trade, and service
    - Found across the globe
    - Has no native speakers
    - Governed by convention, have established vocabulary and grammatical structures
    - Have grammars that are simpler than the grammars of their source languages
    - The vocabulary is usually highly restricted and contains few terms for abstract objects
    - Pidgins are not mutually intelligible with their sources
  - Creole languages - Once children begin to acquire a pidgin as a native language, it becomes a creole
    - As children acquire a pidgin as an L1, they transform its minimal grammar into a thorough, complex grammar
    - Not broken versions of another language → perception comes from presence of the lexifier language
    - Essentially the result of colonization, arose because groups of speakers needed to communicate
      - No group large enough to strongly push their own language
  - Phonetics and phonology
    - Simplified consonant clusters
    - Stopping of fricative
    - Pidgins and creoles tend to have sounds that are common across languages
      - Cross-linguistically rare sounds are not found
      - Pidgins are not tonal, even when the input languages are tonal
    - Pidgins lack inflectional morphology
      - Use of reduplication to indicate plural
      - Not uncommon for creoles to lack inflectional morphology, but some do have it
    - Pidgins may have flexible word order
      - Creoles tend to have more fixed word order
      - Basic word order tends to be subject-verb-object
    - No complex sentences in pidgins
      - Creoles have complex sentences since they have fully developed grammars
    - Pidgins don't have definite or indefinite articles
      - Many creoles lack articles, but some do have them
    - Creoles have fully developed tense systems
- Endangerment and death
  - This occurs when people no longer speak a particular language
    - Usually because they adopt another language
  - Scale of language loss (ethnologue)
    - 5% of the world's languages are spoken by 94% of people
    - ~7% are almost extinct
    - Unequal distribution → hotspots of linguistic diversity
    - About 90% of the human languages are on the verge of being lost
  - Language death - when the last speaker of a language dies
  - Language shift - process by which a language community adopts another language
    - Almost always precedes language death
  - Based on study that there will be 50% language loss in the next 100 years
  - Why do we care?
    - We need diversity
    - Human cultures are the result of this diversity
    - Analogy to ecosystem diversity → the ecological system and its residents re valuable in and of themselves
    - Language is an integral part to culture → loss of language is a loss to the culture in which the language is embedded
    - Each language expresses a unique realization of the human experience
    - Language expresses identity
    - Languages are repositories of history
      - Lexicon can give us a window into the past of the speakers of the language
      - For many histories, they are recorded in only a spoken language
    - As languages are lost, speakers lose access to part of their history
    - Languages contribute to the sum total of human knowledge
      - Each language is a repository of shared and accumulated knowledge of speakers over centuries
      - Also counts as the potential loss of future knowledge
    - Languages are interesting in themselves
      - Incredibly complex manifestations of the human mind
      - Loss of language → loss of chance to understand how the mind works
  - Why do languages die?
    - Factors which put people in physical danger
      - Natural disasters leading to death/destruction of habitat
      - Disease
      - Economic exploitation
      - Genocide/war/ethnic murder
    - Factors which change the people's culture
      - Cultural assimilation
      - Military dominance
      - Urbanization
      - Media
      - Bilingualism
    - Stages of assimilation
      - Pressure on people to speak dominant language
      - Results in emerging bilingualism in children
      - Younger generations gifts to the dominant language
      - Results in shame at using the minority language
      - Leads to self-conscious semilingualism
      - Leads to dominant language monolingualism
        - Can occur in a single generation
        - Discovery of what has been lost
      - Forced assimilation → native children forced to assimilate
    - Language death is similar to language shift in that it's a gradual process
    - Functions of one language are taken over in one domain after another by a different language
    - Language death is manifested as a gradual loss of fluency by its speakers, competence gradually erodes over time
    - Language shift is almost inevitable without active language maintenance
    - Thinking that a language is no longer useful may result in language loss
    - Rapid shift occurs when speakers are eager to fit in to society
  - What can we do to prevent language death/shift?
    - Understand factors that affect language shift in the first place
      - Attitudes of the members of the dominant culture → accept the idea of linguistic diversity
        - Applies to dialects of a language as well as minority languages
      - Patterns of languages use: socio-economic factors
        - The more domains a minority language is used it, the easier it is to maintain it
      - Demographic factors
        - Large enough community of speakers
        - The community is able to isolate itself from the influences of the majority
        - Improved roads, buses, TV, etc. are agents of language shift
        - Intermarriage can accelerate language shift towards language of partner who speaks majority language, unless multilingualism is the norm in society
      - Attitudes to the minority language from the speakers
        - Pride and respect for the language
        - Language shift is faster in communities where the ethnic language is not highly valued
        - Symbol of the ethnic identity → less likely for language shift to occur
        - Language is an important component of identity and culture, maintaining a group's identity and culture is important to them → they maintain their ethnic language to maintain their identity
      - Speakers need to have a say in the educational system
        - Show that the language can be used in education, such as the creation of bilingual educational materials
        - Training of native speakers as teachers
        - Creation of language materials that are easy to use
        - Development of written literature, both traditional and new
      - Speakers must have access to electronic technology
        - Allows speakers of minority languages to be in contact with each other

## **12/1: Language Change Over Time**

- Why are languages diverse?
  - Divine intervention - Tower of Babylon
  - Romance languages come from Roman Empire's spread over Europe
    - Various regions get descendants of Latin
  - Social use
  - Maintenance of identity between social groups
    - Notice diversity and act on it
  - Separation from original community followed by innovation in future generations
    - Builds on top of itself
    - Analogous to Darwin's finches
  - Movement
- Learned vs. innate
  - Requires hierarchical grouping
  - Learn how language works by growing up in the community the language is prominent in
  - Instinctually group sound into meaningful units
  - Explains whether languages are similar or diverse
- Can see progression from earliest examples of English to modern English
- Early Middle English Vowel Shortening
  - Long vowel becomes short when it was followed by either 2 consonants or 2 unstressed syllables
- The Great English Vowel Shift - distinguished middle English from modern English
  - Vowels move up
- Languages are genetically related if their histories can be traced back to a single ancestor
  - Comparative method - requires languages have systematic sound correspondences
  - Mass comparison method - find resemblances across language
    - Can statistically rule out missed correspondences or accidental matches if enough data is present
