## Lecture 1: Slavic Nations and Language

- **Indo-European Languages**

  - Composed of a set of distantly-related languages, theorized to have a single root
  - Indo-Iranian (Persian, Tajik, etc.)
  - Armenian
    - Important for the history of the Russian Empire + neighbors + LA
  - Albanian and Greek (Modern and Ancient)
  - Latin and Romance (Romanian/Moldavian, etc.)
    - Extremely important for European history
    - Great influence from French in 19th/20th centuries
    - Spanish/Portuguese were less known/important for Russian civilization
  - Celtic
  - Germanic (Scandinavian languages, but not Finnish)
    - German culture influenced from both outside and inside
  - French and German were the most important languages and cultures
  - Baltic-Slavic (distant)
    - Baltic (Lithuanian and Latvian, but not Estonian)
    - Slavic (East, West, and South)
  - Slavic more related than Romance/Germanic
  - Geography:
    - Scandinavian countries: Norway, Denmark, Sweden
    - Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
    - East Slavic: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine
    - West Slavic: Poland, Slovakia, Czech Rep., Austria, Germany
    - Actual cultural border moves around
    - Geographic border somewhere between Belarus/Ukraine and Poland

- Branches of the Slavic Languages

  - East Slavic (main focus)
    - Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian
      - Belorussian vs. Belarusian => shows how cultures are continually changing
    - Share common history (Old Russian == Old Belorussian == Old East Slavic)
  - West Slavic
    - Polish, Czech, Slovak
    - Polish is the most important in terms of its influence/interference with Russian culture
  - South Slavic
    - Western South Slavic:
      - Yugoslavia
      - Slovenian, Serbian/Croatian (/Bosnian/Montenegrin)
        - Some linguists consider as a single language
    - Eastern South Slavic:
      - Bulgarian and Macedonia, (Old) Church Slavonic
        -  (Old) Church Slavonic - artificial language designed to translate the Bible for Slavic people

- Slavic Nations: East and West

  - Former Soviet Union and Russian Empire (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine)
  - Poland (in 14th-18th century, in a union with Lithuania)
    - Recreated after WWI
  - Former Czechoslovakia (1918-1992)
    - Czech Republic
    - Slovakia

- Slavic Nations: South (`Yug-`)

  - Former Yugoslavia (1918-1991/2003)
    - Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia
  - Bulgaria

- The Cyrillic Script

  - Cyrillic vs. Latin (Roman) script

    - Former Soviet Union:
      - Russia: `CYR`
      - Belarus: `CYR`
      - Ukraine: `CYR`
        - Can see East Slavic uses Cyrillic
    - Poland: `LAT`
    - Former Czechoslovakia
      - Czech Republic: `LAT`
      - Slovakia: `LAT`
    - Former Yugoslavia:
      - Slovenia: `LAT`
      - Croatia: `LAT`
      - Bosnia and Herzegovina: `LAT`/`CYR`
      - Serbia: `CYR`/`LAT`
      - Montenegro: `CYR`/`LAT`
      - Macedonia: `CYR`
      - Bulgaria: `CYR`
      - Eastern Orthodox Christian => `CYR`, Roman Catholic => `LAT`

  - Cyrillic in the former USSR

    - Moldova: until 1989
    - In the following countries `LAT` was used in 1928-1940, then `CYR` (Turkic languages other than Tajikistan)
      - Azerbaijan: until 1991
      - Turkmenistan: until 1993
      - Uzbekistan: until 1992 (still widespread)
      - Kazakhstan: until 2017 (still widespread)
      - Kyrgyzstan: present
      - Tajikistan: present
    - Many changed back after collapse of the USSR

  - Evolution of alphabets

    - Phoenician => Greek and Hebrew

    - Greek => Latin/Roman and Cyrillic

    - Alphabets
