## Lecture 1: Slavic Nations and Language

- **Indo-European Languages**

  - Composed of a set of distantly-related languages, theorized to have a single root
  - Indo-Iranian (Persian, Tajik, etc.)
  - Armenian
    - Important for the history of the Russian Empire + neighbors + LA
  - Albanian and Greek (Modern and Ancient)
  - Latin and Romance (Romanian/Moldavian, etc.)
    - Extremely important for European history
    - Great influence from French in 19th/20th centuries
    - Spanish/Portuguese were less known/important for Russian civilization
  - Celtic
  - Germanic (Scandinavian languages, but not Finnish)
    - German culture influenced from both outside and inside
  - French and German were the most important languages and cultures
  - Baltic-Slavic (distant)
    - Baltic (Lithuanian and Latvian, but not Estonian)
    - Slavic (East, West, and South)
  - Slavic more related than Romance/Germanic
  - Geography:
    - Scandinavian countries: Norway, Denmark, Sweden
    - Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
    - East Slavic: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine
    - West Slavic: Poland, Slovakia, Czech Rep., Austria, Germany
    - Actual cultural border moves around
    - Geographic border somewhere between Belarus/Ukraine and Poland

- Branches of the Slavic Languages

  - East Slavic (main focus)
    - Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian
      - Belorussian vs. Belarusian => shows how cultures are continually changing
    - Share common history (Old Russian == Old Belorussian == Old East Slavic)
  - West Slavic
    - Polish, Czech, Slovak
    - Polish is the most important in terms of its influence/interference with Russian culture
  - South Slavic
    - Western South Slavic:
      - Yugoslavia
      - Slovenian, Serbian/Croatian (/Bosnian/Montenegrin)
        - Some linguists consider as a single language
    - Eastern South Slavic:
      - Bulgarian and Macedonia, (Old) Church Slavonic
        -  (Old) Church Slavonic - artificial language designed to translate the Bible for Slavic people

- Slavic Nations: East and West

  - Former Soviet Union and Russian Empire (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine)
  - Poland (in 14th-18th century, in a union with Lithuania)
    - Recreated after WWI
  - Former Czechoslovakia (1918-1992)
    - Czech Republic
    - Slovakia

- Slavic Nations: South (`Yug-`)

  - Former Yugoslavia (1918-1991/2003)
    - Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia
  - Bulgaria

- The Cyrillic Script

  - Cyrillic vs. Latin (Roman) script

    - Former Soviet Union:
      - Russia: `CYR`
      - Belarus: `CYR`
      - Ukraine: `CYR`
        - Can see East Slavic uses Cyrillic
    - Poland: `LAT`
    - Former Czechoslovakia
      - Czech Republic: `LAT`
      - Slovakia: `LAT`
    - Former Yugoslavia:
      - Slovenia: `LAT`
      - Croatia: `LAT`
      - Bosnia and Herzegovina: `LAT`/`CYR`
      - Serbia: `CYR`/`LAT`
      - Montenegro: `CYR`/`LAT`
      - Macedonia: `CYR`
      - Bulgaria: `CYR`
      - Eastern Orthodox Christian => `CYR`, Roman Catholic => `LAT`

  - Cyrillic in the former USSR

    - Moldova: until 1989
    - In the following countries `LAT` was used in 1928-1940, then `CYR` (Turkic languages other than Tajikistan)
      - Azerbaijan: until 1991
      - Turkmenistan: until 1993
      - Uzbekistan: until 1992 (still widespread)
      - Kazakhstan: until 2017 (still widespread)
      - Kyrgyzstan: present
      - Tajikistan: present
    - Many changed back after collapse of the USSR

  - Evolution of alphabets

    - Phoenician => Greek and Hebrew

    - Greek => Latin/Roman and Cyrillic

    - Alphabets

  - Saints Cyril (Constantine) and Methodius (9th century) - inventors of the Old Church Slavonic language

  - Two Early Alphabets

    - Glagolitic (860s)
      - From `glagoliti` 'to speak'. `glagol` 'verb'
      - Invented by St. Cyril
    - Early Cyrillic (late 9th century)
      - Names after St. Cyril
      - Influenced by Greek
    - Contemporary Russian (1708, revised 1918)
      - Initially: secular vs. church
      - Influenced by Latin
      - Initiated and approved by Peter the Great



## Reading 1: Land and Peoples: From Ancient Times to the Present

- The Land: Physical Features, Climate, and Resources
  - Controlled territory varies throughout history, but the vast amount of land made it hard to establish centralized rule
  - Ural mountains considered the dividing line between European and Asiatic Russia
    - European Russia + Siberia is primarily just a large plain
    - Caucasus Mountains separate Russia and the Caspian + Black Seas
  - Has many large lakes and rivers
    - Longest 3 rivers: Lena, Irtysh, and Ob (all Siberian)
    - European rivers (Dnieper and Volga) more substantial for Russian history
    - Russia often cut off from seas - desire to get access to the Baltic and Black Seas for maritime influence becomes important to Russian history
      - Arctic and Pacific Ocean coastlines relatively insignificant to history => growing in important in modern day
    - Greatest lake in terms of water volume is Siberia's Lake Baikal
    - Caspian Sea is the world's large lake by surface area
  - Russia has an extreme North
    - Long winters with temperatures down to -60ºF and short summers
    - South and West are less extreme, but still have long winters and short summers
  - Unideal rainfall pattern
    - Higher in northwest, decreases as you move southeast
    - Rainfall not plentiful in spring/early summer when it would most help crops
      - Most common during late summer
    - Adversely affects Russia's agriculture
      - In turn, adversely affects diet, population density, and state revenues
      - Possibly caused the extended use of Russia's autocracy and serfdom
  - Can be divided into 4 main vegetation zones: tundra, taiga, mixed forest, steppe
    - Tundra: treeless region, ground beneath the surface is frozen year-round
    - Taiga: permafrost extends from the tundra, coniferous trees
    - Mixed forest: smaller mixed forest belt of coniferous and leaf-bearing trees
      - Much more densely populated, contains Moscow
      - Taken in combination with the taiga, makes up 1/4 of the world's total forest
    - Steppe: Contains few trees 
      - Most fertile soils lie in a black-earth belt that is found between the mixed forest and steppe
        - This area receives rain at the most appropriate times => most productive agricultural area
        - Further north, area is less favorable but was still heavily farmed throughout Russian history
          - Early peasants used the "slash-and-burn" technique
  - Forest and products surrounded most Russians
    - Products used throughout their lifetimes
    - Provided protection
    - Most Russians were ambivalent towards the forest
  - Also ambivalent towards the steppes
    - Fertile, but dangerous due to invasions at the border
    - Rus would collapse when the Mongols invaded
  - Had unequivocal love for the rivers
    - Provided fish, water, and water for crops
    - Best highways in the country => arteries to facilitate trade between villages
    - Only animosity comes from early perceptions of water spirits
  - Nature can be generous to Russia
    - Abundant lumber supply
    - Abundant wildlife => valuable furs
    - Abundant mineral/mineral fuel resources
      - Aluminum is just about the only major mineral resource that Russia lacks
      - Large quantities of these minerals are in locations that are not part of the Russian state/are dangerous to extract from
- Geography's Impact on Colonization and National Identity
  - Russia's geographical conditions helped stimulate expansion and colonization
    - Expanded to acquire better agricultural lands, Siberian furs, and access to warm-water ports
    - Also encouraged by vast network of rivers and poorly defined frontiers
      - These also contributed to a lot of military goals throughout Russia's history
  - Colonization leads to the absorption of many non-Russians => multinational culture
    - Affected both domestic and foreign policies
      - Helped lead to the collapse of the USSR
  - Eurasian Russia also geographically had an impact on history and culture
    - Debate over whether Russia was culturally European => leads to founding of Eurasianism
    - Still debating in the modern time about national identity
- The Peoples: From Ancient Times to the Present
  - Succession of nomadic warriors dominated the southern steppes of modern-day European Russia and Ukraine
    - Near the western end of the vast steppe area stretching from Manchuria to Hungary
  - From 1000 BC to 200 BC, Cimmerians and Scythians controlled the grassy area north of the Black Sea
    - Sarmatians defeated the Scythians and dominated the steppes until they were defeated by the Germanic Goths
    - Germanic Goths were displaced by the Asiatic Huns
    - Later succeeded by the Avars, Turks, Bulgars, and Khazars
  - Before and after the establishment of Rus, the nomadic peoples of the steppe displayed similar characteristics
    - Generally loose tribal federations
    - Survived by breeding horses and animals, moving to prevent overgrazing
    - Sought to enrich their lives by raiding or trading with sedentary people
    - Horses were most valuable as trading assets or cavalry
    - Some became semi-nomadic, becoming involved in more sedentary occupations
      - Pure nomadic lifestyles became a privilege available to the elite
  - Pre-Rus history, the Turkic Khazars gathered tributes from surrounding peoples
    - Included East Slavic tribes, who paid it in furs
    - Forged an important commercial state called Itil, at the mouth of the Volga River
    - Many converted to Judaism, but were tolerant of other religions
  - Rus, Russians, and others competed for steppe land, paid/collected tribute, warred/allied with people of the steppe
  - Closeness of Slavic languages has lead to theorization of common homeland of all Slavs
    - Split into south, west, and east groups by 7th century
      - South: Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia
      - West: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Moravia
      - East: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus
      - Not yet distinct in the Rus era => state they formed was known as Rus
        - Divided by tribes only (about a dozen)
        - Overwhelmingly a farming people
  - Prior to Slavic colonization, area was settled by Finno-Ugric and Baltic peoples
    - By the 9th century, Scandinavian Vikings were present in Rus territories
    - Were raiders and traders
    - Played an important role in organizing the multiethnic trading and tribute-gathering elite that characterized the Rus state
  - By the time of the collapse of the Rus state, a Great Russian ethnic type was emerging from the East Slavic intermingling with the Finnish
    - Some Finnish maintained separate identities
  - As the Russian state expanded, other ethnicities were introduced
    - Ukraine, Belarus, Siberia, part of the Baltic area, Caucuses, and Central Asia
  - By the time of the breakup of the USSR, Russians were barely the majority in the Russian state
