# ANTHRO 4 - Winter '21 - Duranti



[TOC]

## **Lecture 1: Introduction**

- Study languages to gain an understanding of their speakers’ way of thinking, feeling, and acting
  - Assumes that languages in general/particular uses of a specific language reveal information about their speakers’ way of thinking, feeling, and acting
  - Also helps us learn particular properties of languages
- Linguistic anthropology was born in the US/Canada with the study of Native American languages
  - Focus on spoken language, less emphasis on written languages

## **Lecture 2: Boas’ Methods and Transcription**

- Related but distinct fields interested in language documentation
  - Linguistic anthropology, linguistics, sociolinguistics
- Franz Boas - German Jew
  - Came to the US as a geographer
  - Came back to study society and languages, supported by the US gov’t
  - Present view that you should study each language on its own, don’t impose your own ways of thinking/categorizing/etc.
  - Fascinated by the differences between American Indian languages and European languages
    - Distinctions made, qualified, challenged (primitive vs. civilized)
      - Simply based on different world views
  - Worked w/ the Kwakiutl people of the Pacific Northwest
    - Recorded customs, rituals, myths, and artifacts → wrote a grammar for their language
  - Methods
    - Inventing phonetic sounds
    - Conventions to represent sounds not found in European languages
    - Established a coding scheme - a list of phonetic symbols used in the texts
    - Transcript → free translation in English
      - Needed to figure out sound system
    - Each word was analyzed and constituents were separated/classified based on meaning in isolation and in context
  - Interested in differences in American Indian language
    - Articles, conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, and personal pronouns weren’t expressed as individual words, but as affixes on a root or stem
    - Ways of expressing certain attributes (i.e. visibility)
- Transcription
  - Elicitation - ask native speakers to speak 1 utterance at a time
  - Prerequisites
    - Be able to hear sounds with which one might not be familiar
    - Have conventions for transcribing these sounds
      - May or may not use the language’s original orthography
      - Must be done very systematically
    - If there are bilingual speakers, use a second language as a metalanguage
      - Elicitation → translation
    - Awareness of difference of elicited talk between native → non-native and native → native
  - From limited data, learn about nouns, syllables, sounds, stress, word order, ellipsis, morphology, etc.

## **Reading 1: Boas Introduction**

- Focus on discussion of articulate speech
- Character of Phonetics
  - Speech consists of groups of sounds produced by the articulating organs, opening/closing places in the larynx, pharynx, mouth, or nose, restricting certain parts of the passage of breath, and resonant sounds produced by the vocal cords
  - The number of sounds we can produce is unlimited
    - Each language selects only a subset of sounds - never excessively large
      - Necessary to make rapid communication → better muscle memory/linguistic performance
    - Comparison of languages/dialects reveals that there is considerable variation in the manner of producing sounds
    - Each dialect has its own characteristic phonetic system
  - One group of sounds is produced by the vibration of the vocal cords and characterized by the form of the mouth and nose vowels
    - Closed nose - pure vowels
    - More/less open - nasalized vowels
    - All other sounds are consonants
      - Produced by closing the air passages completely, then suddenly opening the closure (stops) or by producing a narrowing/- stricture at any point (spirants/continued)
      - Stop + stricture = affricate
      - Stops with no vibration of vocal cords = surds
      - Voiced consonants = sonants
      - English - stress of articulation of the voiced sound is less than the stress of articulation of the unvoiced sound
      - Sounds accompanied by full breathing = aspirates - `‘`
      - Voicing on consonants may be before, during, or after the consonant
    - `i` and `u` show close affiliation to consonants of the continuant series
      - Create semi-vowels `w` and `y`
  - These phonetic rules are practiced by speakers unconsciously
    - Single phonetic elements only become conscious to us as a result of analysis
- Grammatical Categories
  - Languages also differ in the groups of ideas that find expression in fixed phonetic groups
  - Total # of ideas that are expressed by distinct phonetic groups is limited
    - Extended classification of experiences must underlie all articulate speech
      - No 2 senses/emotions are identical → we still classify them in groups based on their similarities
      - We recognize common elements in our experience to fit within the limited phonetic groupings
        - If this weren’t true, we’d need an infinite number of phonetic groups and similar experiences wouldn’t be connected
    - Ideas expressed by specific phonetic groups show very material differences in different languages, do not conform to the same principles of classification
  - Selection of terms depends on the chief interests of the people that speak the language
    - May be necessary to distinguish other things with an entirely different term or just a simple modification of the original from a case by case basis
    - Makes each language appear arbitrary in classifications
    - Tendency of a language to express a complex idea by a single term - holophrasis
      - Cannot be taken as a fundamental characteristic of primitive languages
  - Classification of expression must be found in every language
    - Concepts that do not have words must be expressed by combinations of elementary phonetic groups
    - Entails the presence of formal elements that determine the relations of the single phonetic groups
      - Larger vocabulary of single phonetic groups = less formal elements required
  - The number of processes which are used to express the relations of terms is limited
    - Can only use composition in definite order and inner modification of the phonetic groups themselves
  - The natural unit of expression is the sentence - a group of articulate sounds that convey a complete idea
    - Word - a phonetic group which, owing to its permanence of form, clearness of significance, and phonetic independence, is readily separated from the whole sentence
      - Phonetic independence makes the limitation of the word unit very uncertain due to the difference in phonetic strength of the components
      - Ambiguity can also rise when meanings become dependent on other parts of the sentence, or the meaning is vague/weak compared to the rest of the sentence
  - Analytic treatment of languages requires the separation of a number of different groups of the elements of speech
    - When arranged based on function, certain elements recur in every sentence
      - Subject and predicate
    - Material contents of the sentence may be represented by subjects and predicates expressing an unlimited number of ideas
      - Appear to us as the subject matter of lexicography
    - Modifying elements comprise a very small number of ideas
      - Appear to us as the subject matter of grammar
    - Distinction between grammar and lexicography is obscure → number of elements in formal compositions is very large
      - Modifying elements combine with words to create the lexicography of the language
    - Affix - elements attached to stems or words that modify them
      - Ok definition when the number of modifying ideas is limited
- Discussion of Grammatical Categories
  - Must consider the constituent phonetic elements of the language, the groups of ideas expressed by phonetic groups, and the methods of combining and modifying phonetic groups
  - Look at Indo-European parts of speech
  - Nouns are classified according to gender, singular/plural, and cases
    - None of these are necessary aspects of articulate speech
  - Gender
    - May be suppressed without interfering with clearness of expression
      - In English, inanimate objects have come to belong to a single gender
  - Plural
    - Added context/adjectives can make plurality dispensable
    - European languages lean on plurality for clearness of expression
  - Case
    - Case relation is confined to the 2 forms of subject and object
    - Case expressions are not entirely eliminated, but can be largely reduced from what we see in European languages
  - Tense
  - Pronouns
    - Accustomed to 3 persons, in both singular and plural
    - Based off of concepts of self and not-self
      - Not-self broken up into person addressed and person spoken of
    - Lack of clear distinction between singular and plural in slime languages
    - Some languages distinguish between personal and demonstrative pronouns
      - These divisions are necessary parts of the languages they occur in
  - Verbs have expressions signifying persons, tenses, modes, and voices
    - Persons is often not given form
    - Tense and mode differences are much more fundamental to verbs
      - Strict expression of time relation is missing in many languages
      - False
    - Many “essential” categories are absent in other languages
- Interpretation of Grammatical Categories
  - In each language, only a part of the complete concept that we have in mind is expressed
    - Each language picks particular aspects of this idea to communicate verbally
  - In a discussion of the characteristics of various languages, different fundamental categories will be found
  - Giving each language a proper place requires the comparison of both phonetic and grammatical characteristics

## **Reading 2: The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages**

- Language is an instrument of thought and of the communication of thought
  - The study of language aims to properly use this instrument
  - We are driven towards a scientific study of language
  - Contributed to by advancements in psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc.
- When translating from a language to English, we cannot give a rough substitute, we must explain the meaning of each word  through an exact ethnographic account of the sociology, culture, and tradition of that native community
  - The ways in which their grammatical structure differs from ours is very telling
  - Extreme simplicity hides expressiveness
  - Ethnographers have to convey subtle differences of language and of the mentality behind them/expressed by them
  - An ideal translator could not make you understand the meaning of a single utterance in a primitive language → need context
    - Listener requires understanding of the situation in which the words were spoken
    - Requires placement in the proper setting of the native culture
    - Requires understanding of the emotional nature of the utterance
- In Indo-European languages, grammatical and lexical function of words are distinct
  - Unclear in primitive languages
  - In primitive languages, the meaning of a single word is heavily dependent on context
  - The conception of meaning as contained within an utterance is false
    - Spoken statements are never detached from the environment in which they are spoken
- Special consideration given to language when used in free, aimless, social intercourse
  - Seemingly deprived of context of situation
  - There is in all human beings the tendency to congregate and enjoy each other’s company
    - Speech is the intimate correlate of this tendency
- Every human language has a definite structure
  - The means of linguistic action and expression can be brought under certain rules and classified according to certain categories
  - As language and thought develop, the constant action of metaphor, generalization, analogy, and abstraction build links between categories and cross boundary lines

## **Reading 3: Aspects of the Theory of Syntax**

- Linguistic theory is concerned with an ideal speaker-listener
  - To study actual linguistic performance, we must consider the interaction of a variety of factors
  - The study of language is no different from empirical investigation of other complex phenomena
- Distinguish between competence and performance
  - Only in the ideal situation described above does performance = competence
  - Problem rises for the linguist to determine competence from performance
  - Linguistic theory is mentalistic - concerned with discovering a mental reality underlying actual behavior
- A grammar of a language purports to be a description of the ideal speaker-hearer’s intrinsic competence
  - If the grammar is perfectly explicit, it is a generative grammar
  - A fully adequate grammar must assign to each of an infinite range of sentences a structural description indicating how this sentence is understood by the ideal speaker-hearer
    - Traditional problem of descriptive linguistics
  - Traditional grammars leave many basic regularities of the language unexpressed
    - Grammars may contain full and explicit lists of exceptions and irregularities, but only provide examples and hints regarding the regular and productive syntactic processes
- Within traditional linguistic theory, it’s understood that one of the qualities all languages share is their creativity
  - Provides the means for expressing indefinitely many thoughts and for reacting appropriately to an indefinite range of new situations
  - Grammar of a particular language is supplemented by a Universal Grammar
    - Not explicitly recognized by modern linguistics
  - Concept understood, but the technical devices for expressing a system of recursive processes was not available until recently
- Generative grammar - a system of rules that in some explicit and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences
  - Every speaker of a language has mastered and internalized a generative grammar, but may not be aware of it
  - Generative grammars deal with mental processes that are far beyond the level of actual consciousness
  - Attempts to specify what the speaker actually knows, not what he reports he knows
  - Not a model for speaker or hearer, attempts to characterize the knowledge of the language in the most neutral terms possible

## **Lecture 3: Phonetic Descriptions**

- Boas and Malinowski share an interest in culture
  - Language is an important instrument to getting into culture
  - Establish anthropology as science
    - Boas - inductive
  - Both collect texts for transcription
    - Boas - wants to be as scientific as possible, but understands bias of transcribers
      - Transcribers must overcome the bias of their native languages - linguistic relativity
    - Malinowski - pragmatic force of language
      - Language is a form of social action
      - Civilized people use language to reflect upon the world → realizes that civilized people and primitive people are the same linguistically
      - Developed the concept of the context of situation
        - In order to understand the language, you need to understand the context
- Methods, data, and theory are 3 dimensions of research projects
  - Are interdependent - they interact and influence each other
  - Methods - inductive vs. deductive ways of documenting, recording,m transcribing, selecting data, turning sources/images, observations into data
  - Data - the outcome of documentation, to be analyzed through theory
  - Theory - research goals, identify issues and concepts, making generalizations, hypotheses
- Recall
  - Boas developed an inductive method for documenting American Indian languages
    - Included working with native speakers to collect texts and use them to document local traditions and write grammars/dictionaries
  - Elicitation of Aymara words and sentences shows how a linguist works and what you can learn from a few sentences
  - Aymara is an example of the language diversity encountered early on in documenting American Indian languages
  - Language as a human faculty
    - Vocal tract to speak, face and hands to sign
- Development of the IPA to capture sounds symbolically in a universal orthography
- Distinctive sounds (phonemes)
  - 2 goals for transcribing linguistic sounds:
    - Getting the sounds right and transcribing them in a consistent way
    - Figuring out which sound differences matter for phonemes - language has a subset of the possible sound differences that are meaningful or phonemes
  - Use of vocal cords vs. non-use, voicing vs. voiceless
  - Aspiration matters in Aymara
- Boas
  - Each language has a limited repertoire of
    - Basic linguistic sounds (phonemes)
    - Possible linguistic sound combinations
  - Pronunciation of sounds is affected by surrounding sounds
  - Previously acquired sounds influence how speakers hear new and unfamiliar linguistic sounds and sound combinations
    - Early example of linguistic relativity
    - Present in study of primitive languages → thought to originally be evidence of linguistic disorganization
    - Concludes there are no alternating sounds, occurrence is due to alternating perception
  - Haida
    - Boas reports he cannot hear the difference between we and you
    - Later reports he could hear the difference
  - Flipping the test
    - Second test is to ask the native speakers of another language to speak our language → they also misperceive our sounds
  - Overcome our biases is a big focus of anthropology
  - Languages limit choices (phonotactics)
    - Each language favors certain sounds or combinations of sounds and avoids other combinations
- Malinowski - beginning of British social anthropology
  - Studied in the Trobriands
  - Ethnography - goal is to grasp the natives’ point of view
  - Understand the meaning of words as understood by the native speakers
  - Language is to be regarded as a mode of action rather than a countersign of thought
    - Words rooted in pragmatic efficiency
    - In most abstract and theoretical aspects of human thought, the real understanding of words is derived from active experience of those aspects of reality
  - Real linguistic fact is the full utterance within its context of situation
- Portable tape recorder
  - Recording of spontaneous speech at normal speed becomes possible
  - Ethnographers of speaking studied speech events
  - Some sociologists started to study conversation

## **Reading 4: On Alternating Sounds**

- “Sound blindness” - people cannot distinguish differences in key and timber of sounds that are normally easily discernible
  - Name comes from similarity to color-blindness
  - Characteristic feature is inability to perceive the essential peculiarities of certain sounds
  - Research on hearing of certain consonants and vowels
    - Well known that the first time hearing a word is subject to misunderstanding
      - Word may be so long that we’re unable to grasp all its phonetic components in sequence
      - We may fail to perceive a particular characteristic of each phonetic component
- Consider failure to perceive particular characteristic
  - Generally test on children → easier to find unknown words
  - Children write down novel words → researchers analyze the ones they misspell
    - Long words gave unsatisfactory results - children failed to grasp the sequence of component sounds
    - Monosyllabic words occasionally subject to substitution of the word
  - Results show that sounds are not perceived by the hearer in the same way they are pronounced by the speaker
- There is always slight variation in our sound producing system when we attempt to produce a sound
  - Circumstances will change the sound we intend to produce
  - When we hear a sound, we take the vibrations generated by the sound waves and perceive it in the context of sounds familiar to us → classify by similarity
  - Possibility that the difference between 2 distinct sounds is so small, it doesn’t exceed the differential threshold
    - Sound itself is replaced by a similar sounds (`f` → `th`)
    - Entire word is replaced by a similar word (`fan` → `clam`)
- Leads to belief that there is no such thing as alternating sounds
  - Tends to be associated with primitive languages
  - Likely just a result of alternating perceptions of transcribers
    - Influenced by native language
  - Test that various sounds that resemble a known sound occur as frequently for any primitive language
  - Test that people that speak a primitive language hear our own language as consisting of alternating sounds
- Sound blindness and alternating sounds really result of alternating perceptions

## **Reading 5: Science and Linguistics**

- Talking and its connection to thinking
  - Speech habits automatic → notions tend to be intolerant of opposition
  - Based in system of natural logic (common sense)
  - Every person has talked since infancy → every person is their own authority on his process of formulation and communication
  - Talking is strictly meant to communicate, not formulate ideas
    - Thinking is meant to formulate ideas → thought to be indifferent to the nature of language
    - Grammar guides communication vs. rational thinking guides communication
  - Logically, different languages are simply parallel ways of expressing the same rationale of thought
    - Universal rationale that can be found by speakers of all languages
- People that can only see blue
  - Can’t understand that all they saw was blue
  - Blue means nothing to them
  - Language would lack perception of color
  - Would require exceptional moments where they saw other colors for understanding of situation
  - Analogous to gravity for an uneducated person → before understanding gravity, a person cannot imagine a world without it
- Fallacies of natural logic
  - The phenomena of a language are outside the critical consciousness and control of a speaker who is thinking about natural logic
    - Confined to think in terms of your native language
  - Natural logic confuses agreement about subject matter with knowledge of the linguistic process through which it is attained
- A and B can communicate perfectly
  - A gives directions for B to carry out
  - How does B know what to do?
  - Linguistic patterns and classifications required for this to occur is background to both participants
  - Link background to actions
- Overt knowledge of the linguistic processes by which agreement is reached is not necessary to find agreement
  - Knowledge of the processes may become an aid
  - A sailor can sail a ship without the knowledge of geography, astronomy, mathematics, etc.
    - A captain needs this knowledge to perform his duty
- As linguists gained the ability to scientifically study a large number of languages, it became evident that grammar doesn’t just help voice ideas, it shapes them too
  - We dissect nature along lines laid out by our native languages
  - World is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which must be organized by the linguistic systems in our minds
    - Cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significance based on the codification of our language
  - No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality → we’re all constrained to certain modes of interpretation
    - Most free is a linguist familiar with many widely different linguistic systems
  - Observers are not led by the same physical existence to the same conclusions, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar
  - English tends to divide words into 2 classes → gives us a bipolar division of nature
    - Not possible to define certain things in nature → circular reasoning back to the native language
- Grand generalizations are not essential to the construction of a consistent picture of the universe
  - Hopi doesn’t have a concept of time

## **Reading 6: Coral Gardens and Their Magic**

- Ethnographers have to see/hear their subject, witness the rites, ceremonies, and activities, collect opinions on them
  - Active, personal, and visual side are main concern
  - Language is the ethnographer’s most important tool
  - Value of linguistic data is only in proportion to the ethnographer’s own knowledge and accuracy in drawing inferences
    - Obliged to disclose his linguistic background to present credentials
- Methodologically interesting to know whether a statement is an answer to a direct question, a volunteered statement, or a traditional saying
- Usually think of language as a means to an end
  - Language stands in a definite relation to the life of the people who speak it and to their mental habits and attitudes
  - Dangerous to think that language is a parallel process that corresponds directly to mental process/language is meant to duplicate the mental reality of man in  a secondary flow of verbal equivalents
  - Language is meant to play a pragmatic part in human behavior
- Trobriand case study
  - Language consists of movements, words, and gestures
  - Speech is thought as equivalent to gesture and motion
  - Words without context are meaningless
  - In order to reconstruct the meaning of sounds, it is necessary to describe the bodily behavior of the speaker, know the purpose of the action, and the sociology of the people
  - Indicates the character of human speech in general and the necessary methodological approach to it
  - Words are a part of and equivalent to action
- Force ourselves to define meaning in terms of experience and situation
- Language is never a shadow of some other cultural reality
  - It is a verbal act by which native belief exercises the most powerful influence on the course of nature and on human behavior
  - Is a social organizing force
  - Is a cultural aspect in its own right
    - Type of human behavior which plays a part of its own, unique and irreplaceable
- Translation of individual terms is seemingly the easiest linguistic task
  - In reality, it’s as difficult as any other task
  - Real linguistic fact is the full utterance within its context of situation
  - The words of one language are never translatable into another
  - When translating to a word in our culture, it’s important to not assimilate the uses, form, and material of the native version with those of our own
  - Context of culture supplies us with the relevant elements to translate these words
- Words are progressively defined by reference to the ethnographic description, supplemented by additional information concerning linguistic usage
- It’s impossible to define a word by equation
- Only full ethnographic description can serve as a basis for linguistic analysis
- Words do not exist in isolation
- Arguing that the theoretical uses of words in modern philosophic and scientific writing are detached from pragmatic sources is an error

## **Reading 7: Linguistic Anthropology: Language as a Non-Neutral Medium**

- Ontological commitments
  - Means the programmatic interest to pursue topics and questions that are generate or justified by a particular ontology of language
  - Often assumed that language is designed to be a method of communication
  - Sometimes assumed that language is designed for recursion
  - Focus on 3 properties
    - Language is a code for representing experience
    - Language is a form of social organization
    - Language is a system of differentiation
- Commitment to language as a non-neutral code
  - Linguistic expressions stand for/carry meanings
    - Meanings not agreed on - intentions vs. conventions
    - Meaning is formed in the speaker’s mind to be captured
    - Meaning is an emergent structure, interactional achievement, or embodied predisposition
  - By linguistically encoding human experience, speakers submit to particular ways of categorizing and conceptualizing the world
  - Classificatory biases
    - One of the first clear statements on the relationship between language and worldview was given by Wilhelm von Humboldt
    - Boas points out that languages differ in the ways they routinely classify experience or divide up the natural/cultural world that humans inhabit
      - No claim that linguistic differences affect the way people think or what they say, but recognition of the influence of the sounds of our native language and the ways in which we can hear sound distinctions in other languages
  - Linguistic relativity
    - Whorf provided guidelines for establishing the ways language, thought, and behavior are interconnected
      - By speaking a specific language, we organize experience in the way it is codified by that language
    - Use of analogy
      - Having the same word for a variety of objects/experiences encourages speakers to categorize those referents as the same or as experientially related
    - Yucatec study
      - Yucatec marks plural much less than English → Yucatec speakers pay less attention to number than English speakers
      - Yucatec classification of nouns in terms of substance vs. English classification in terms of shape → grouping of objects by substance vs. shape
  - Habituation
    - Language is a habit
      - It is something we do not question
      - We experience language use as something automatic
    - 2 main trends
      - Routine aspects of linguistic encoding are made sense of in terms of mental representations
        - Schema - abstract construct that allows for the recognition and interpretation of a potentially infinite number of cases
          - Sometimes conceived of as involving scenes or part-whole relationships that provide background information
          - Highly cultural
      - Habitus - disposition
        - A way of being that is experience passively
        - Particular kind of practical knowledge connecting a person with familiar objects and activities
        - Allows us to view language itself as a set of unconscious dispositions rather than rules
        - Can be limiting in terms of the range of new communicative situations to which people can adapt
    - Language views as being composed of more than lexicon and grammar, but also communicative resources like prosody, tempo, volume, gestures, posture, writing, and visualization
  - Overcoming the linguistic bias
    - 2 properties of language that provide us the means to overcome linguistic biases
      - Reflexivity - humans’ ability to reflect upon their own actions and their meanings
        - Routinely manifested through language → shown by the fact we can use language to talk about language
      - Language socialization - continued reception of new socializing agents and activities
        - Ability to acquire new habits
        - Opportunity to reflect on our past, current, and potential ways of being
        - Often expressed through speech and other symbolic means
    - Empirical analysis
      - Children grow up multilingual → must manage multiple worldviews
      - Adults can learn a new language and think in that language → shows ability to adopt other ways of thinking later in life
      - Can train self to be aware of sociocultural and political implications of our ways of speaking
    - Speakers can devise new linguistic practices to overcome prejudice/other negative social attitudes
    - Overcoming linguistic bias requires a double commitment
      - Move beyond the naïve view that awareness of language habits will lead to change/speakers can easily become aware of the impact of their habits
        - Habits are victims of inertia → giving them up requires particular social circumstances and individual life experiences and skills
      - Overcome the deterministic, fatalistic, and cynical view that our language is a prison from which we cannot escape
  - Language as a form of social organization
    - Language began getting seen as predominantly an action rather than a code
      - Distinguish meaning from force
    - Shift attention of language study from language to speaking
    - Don’t write about grammars and ethnologies, instead write about what’s left out of both → the ways in which our ways of speaking organize our social life
    - Humans constantly interact and try to get things done using language
    - Language use is constitutive of our social life → speaking doesn’t happen in social interaction, speaking itself is social interaction
    - Conversation analysis
      - Study a conversation as a prominent site of social organization
        - Conversational turn-taking is rule-governed while also being flexible enough for individuals to engage in different kinds of activities
        - Room left for individual and contextual variation
      - Sentence is the largest unit of analysis
      - Type of speech act that speakers perform is sensitive to the type of recipient that end up securing through eye-gaze
        - Speakers are very sensitive to their interactional context and adjust their social moves accordingly
      - Any previously conceived goal of a speaker must adapt to circumstances, as mediated by the principles of conversational turn-taking
    - Genres
      - Study genres in terms of performance
      - Awareness of the international demands and consequences of the performance of a given genre is important for understanding their role in organizing principles of social action
      - Offers opportunity to study how verbal performance is linked to other modalities
      - Samoan organization of speaking allows for social control of negative emotions and favors a limited exchange of information about the causes of a given issue
      - Variety of genres found within/across societies corresponds to the variety of social contexts that those genres help establish and control
    - Registers
      - Publicly recognized cluster of linguistic features associated with particular cultural practices and types of people who engage in them
      - Each individual has a register range that provides a corresponding range of identities and roles
      - Some registers imply a specific type of listener
      - Ways of speaking have an impact on what participants in the interaction can accomplish cognitively and interactionally
  - Language as a system of differentiation
    - Focus on diversity within the same community of speakers
    - Instead of thinking about linguistic diversity in cognitive terms, study linguistic bases of social prestige and the differential access that speakers have
    - Focus on how language is used to establish, maintain, and challenge social differentiation
    - Language ideologies
      - Explored the practical implications of speakers’ beliefs about how their own language is structured and used
      - Linguistic choice found to be used as a weapon for discrimination
      - All perspectives on language are imbued with sociopolitical/personal investments
      - Iconization - speakers interpret certain linguistic features as indications of particular qualities of persons/groups
      - Fractal recursivity - Speakers project differences in one thing into differences in another thing
      - Erasure - ignoring or reducing complexities
      - Symbolic domination - the social value of the language varieties that we speak is given by the place of such varieties within a linguistic market that we cannot control
    - Differentiation through narrative society
      - Fathers tend to be the preferred recipients of narratives of personal experience
        - Also the most likely to question the actions reported in a narrative
      - Mothers most likely to have their actions questioned and scrutinized
      - Evidence of the collective construction within the family
      - Classroom interaction also important for narrative activities
    - Honorifics
      - The language used to talk to, about, and around people of high social rank
      - Use of alternative address forms, verbal morphology, and special lexical items
      - Suggests that linguistic features are not just indexes of qualities of individuals, but also indexes of qualities of activities
      - Variability in use of honorifics highlights the fact that participants have opportunities for negotiation and manipulation of social differentiation through their linguistic resources
- Language as a non-neutral medium highlights both continuity and discontinuity in the history of linguistic anthropology
  - Continuity - represented by ontological commitment to language as a non-neutral medium
  - Discontinuity - represented by different concepts of language

## **Lecture 4: Linguistic Diversity and Relativity**

- Malinowski
  - Language is an instrument of thinking and of the communication of thinking → civilized perspective → 1st attempt
    - Coral Gardens → 2nd attempt → language is always an instrument of action
  - In order to understand other languages, we can get to the literal meaning of an utterance, but that lacks the context needed for true understanding
  - Words don’t exist in isolation → context of cultural reality
- Boas and his students’ study of American Indian languages showed both different ways of encoding information in a word and different kinds of information that was encoded
  - Do speakers of different languages have different understandings of the world?
  - Different aspects are encoded based on different interests of the people
- 2 concepts:
  - Linguistic diversity - languages differ in what they encode and how they do it
    - Polysynthetic languages, inflectional languages, agglutinative languages, isolating languages (most words are monosyllabic, use of tones to convey meaning)
  - Linguistic relativity - there are consequences for the different ways that languages have to encode information
- Language as a shaper of ideas
  - Formulation of ideas is not an independent process, but is part of particular grammar and differs between grammars
  - Language helps us and is very powerful, but it also slows us down by trapping us in the categories it confines us to
- Translating is a risk, an approximation of meaning based on your knowledge
  - We still get a lot out of translation
- Nouns and verbs: are they natural classes?
  - Our language gives us a bipolar division of nature
  - Do not take for granted the way in which European languages divide up the world - Whorf
    - Nature itself isn’t divided, it’s being forcefully divided by language
  - Nouns - long standing, stable events, things
  - Verbs - temporary events
  - Tense - encodes when with respect to the now
  - Aspect encodes duration, initiation, completion
  - Different in other languages, analysis characterized by English bias
- Reflexivity, language socialization as a never-ending process, we can become aware of our limits

## **Reading 8: How to Do Things with Words**

- It’s been assumed that the point of a statement is to describe some state of affairs or fact
  - Regularly pointed out by grammarians that not all sentences are used to make statements
  - There are also questions, exclamations, commands, wishes, concessions
  - How do we separate these purposes?
- This difficulty remained unquestioned for some time, now more scrutiny
  - Statement or fact ought to be verifiable → most statements are really pseudo-statements
    - Kant - most statements are nonsense
    - Do these pseudo-statements even intend to be statements at all?
      - We often use utterances in ways beyond the scope of traditional grammar
      - Many special words that are embedded in statements do not indicate any feature of reality, but instead indicate context/information about the subject
        - Overlooking this is called the descriptive fallacy
- Preliminary isolation of the performative
  - Doesn’t masquerade as a statement of fact → however, that’s the most common occurrence + most explicit form
  - Utterances can be found such that
    - They do not describe or report or state anything at all, are not true or false
    - The uttering of the sentence is, or is a part of, the doing of an action, which again would not normally be described as saying something
- Promising - a performative utterance
  - Appropriate that the person uttering the promise should have a certain intention → to keep their word
  - When such intention is absent → false promise
  - Utterance is misleading, implies a falsehood or misstatement → false is not used in statements only

## **Reading 9: Theoretical Concerns in Contemporary Linguistic Anthropology**

- 3 major areas: performance, indexicality, and participation
- Participation
  - Chomsky - distinguish between competence and performance
    - de Saussure - distinguish between langue (system as a whole) and parole (language of a particular user of the system)
    - Competence - capacity for language (mostly unconscious)
      - Ideal speaker
    - Performance - actual use of the language, based on competence, attention, perception, and memory
  - Austin - all utterances do something (change reality, inform, etc.)
  - Folklore studies, poetics, and the arts - special attention given to the ways in which communicative acts are executed
    - Jakobson - the “poetic” function of speech
    - Dimension of human life most typically emphasized in music, theater, etc.
    - Focus on phrasing, delivery, effect on audience, etc.
    - Dimension of risk or challenge
  - We are constantly being evaluated by our listeners and by ourselves
  - Performance implies creativity and improvisation
  - To be a fluent speaker means to be able to enter any conversation in ways that are appropriate/not disruptive
- Indexicality
  - Kant - distinguish between arbitrary and natural signs
    - Arbitrary - letters representing linguistic sounds
      - Letters only stand for sounds because of established convention within a community
    - Natural - smoke means fire
      - Established by knowledge of a recurring natural phenomenon
      - Smoke connected spatio-temporally and physically to the fire and acquires meaning from it
  - Indexes - signs that have some kind of existential relation with what they refer to
    - Extends to much of linguistic communication
    - A word or expression can be used to index a past or future experience
    - Code switching
    - Range from innocuous inquiries to political commitments
  - Silverstein - distinguish among different degrees of indexicality
  - Used for the construction of ethnic/gender identities
  - Recognition that words carry a power that goes beyond the description/identification of people, objects, properties, and events
  - Gumperz - interactional work is done through contextualization cues - indexical signs which let people know what is going on in any given situation
  - Defines power relations/dynamics
- Participation
  - Speaking is seen, above all else, as a social activity involving more than just linguistic expressions
  - Being a speaker of a language → being a member of a speech community
  - Given access to a range of activities and uses of a language
  - Participation stresses the inherently social, collective, and distributed quality of any act of speaking
  - Connects to larger world using performative power and indexicality
  - Assumes cognition to manage the retrieval of information
  - Assumes a corporeal component that interacts with the environment physically and meaningfully
  - Implies the sharing of material and ideational resources
    - Does not assume a equally shared knowledge or control of such resources
  - Meaning is often constructed by the juxtaposition of different voices

## **Reading 10: A Focus on Performance**

- Chomsky
  - Performance - perception and production
  - Scientific method requires us to ignore performance because it’s subject to errors
- Chomsky extended by Hymes
  - Performance is a realm of social action, emerges out of interaction with other speakers
    - Cannot be described in terms of individual knowledge
  - Focused on the positive and creative nature of performance
  - View of speakers as performers allows us to broaden the analytical horizon of language use
    - Recognizes a different notion of creativity - ability to adapt speech to the situation/vice versa
      - Also the ability to extend, manipulate, and reframe meaning in a way that is related to the poetic language
    - Recognizes individuals’ unique contribution to any given situation and to the evolution of any linguistic tradition
      - Formal linguistics favors the linguistic forms over users → makes this hard
    - Singles out situations in which speakers are accountable for what they say and the way they say it
      - Unites the aesthetics of speaking with their social and political implications
    - Recognizes the roles of the audience in the construction of messages and their meanings
      - Also the complexity underlying the distinction between speaker and hearer
      - Relatively little work done on spontaneous verbal interaction in everyday life
- The Power of Language
  - 2 strategies for analyzing the relationship between language and culture
    - Start from linguistic forms and try to discover what those forms accomplish in the construction of everyday life
    - Linguistic relativity - arbitrary nature and implicit worldview are seen as constraints on the ways in which individual speakers as members of speech communities perceive reality or are able to represent it
    - Metalinguistic and metapragmatic awareness - provides framework for thinking about the power of specific linguistic forms to reveal or to hide their indexical values
    - Traditional political oratory provides a framework for the unconscious acceptance of authority and the status quo
    - Formalized speech restricts the range of possible questions and possible answers and therefore limits freedom of expression
    - Ideas strengthened the ties between political anthropology and linguistic anthropology
    - Start from a cultural construct or social process and then try to find out how specific linguistic forms participate in such constructs or processes
  - Invention of literacy
    - Argument that alphabetic writing had a crucial role in the development of Western civilization
      - Oral → written, introduced the practice of history
    - Most linguistic anthropologists have come to the conclusion that there are different types of literacy
    - Ideological model of literacy - perspective that links writing practices to power structures in society
      - Stressed importance for ethnographic studies of literacy
    - Revives earlier interest in schooling and classroom interaction
      - Relation between literacy and the formation of class, gender, racial, and ethnic identities
    - Technological revolution
      - Extended notion of literacy so that we now talk about video/computer literacy
      - Analysts can now study the simultaneous operations that produce any stretch of talk
      - New kinds of inscription allow us to see talk as produced by multiple semiotic tools like the body, environment, and material tools
      - Context now seen as the product of specific ways of behaving
      - Analyst’s job to reconstruct the process of contextualization
        - Context is both within the situation being analyzed and outside of it (researchers frame the situation to analyze it)
  - Professional vision
    - Coding - transforms phenomena observed in a specific setting into the objects of knowledge that animate the discourse of a profession
    - Highlighting - makes specific phenomena in a complex perceptual field salient by marking them in some fashion
    - Producing and articulating material representations
  - Standard dialects
    - Used for one community to dominate another
    - Common in the formation of a nation-state
    - Used as a weapon by central government against linguistic minorities
    - Language and political/economic institutions
      - It is not sufficient for a dominant class to rule through state institutions, it must also impose its own intellectual and moral standards - hegemony
      - Habitus - unconscious set of dispositions that are connected to and recursively activated by participation in specific activities
      - Cultural capital - think of linguistic varieties as having a value within a market
- Basic assumption of linguistic anthropology is that, to understand the meaning of linguistic messages, one must study them in their respective contexts
- Different names for the study of language can be resolved by a historical overview of the methods, goals, and academic affiliation of the researchers involved
  - Anthropological linguistics reveals a strong identification with the discipline of linguistics
  - Starts from an understanding of speaking as an activity that has its own cultural organization
    - Studied using a combination of linguistic analysis and ethnography
- Linguistic anthropology started as an effort to document and describe the aboriginal North American languages
- Early encounters with the languages of Native Americans sparked interest in what a language could reveal about the speakers’ view of the world
  - Increased understanding of the complexities of linguistic forms and their organization in systems suggested a constraint on speakers’ ability to view the world from an unbiased perspective
- The study of language as a cultural resource has motivated the extension of competence to include socio-cultural knowledge
  - Notion of community is likely to expand and include aggregates that are not defined by face-to-face communication and take into consideration the impact of old and new media on language use
- Shift from an interest in what language encodes to what language does
  - Fosters an interest in social and cultural organization of linguistic activities and indexicality
- Language socialization looks at the impact of cultural expectations and social interaction on the acquisition of language and at the role of language in creating competent and productive members of society
- Language has many powers
  - Contemporary linguistic anthropology uses a variety of analytical tools and concepts to examine the power of language in a wide range of social situations
  - Race, gender, class, etc. are treated as interdependent factors

## **Lecture 5: From Words to Acts**

- Greetings
  - Greetings change over time
  - A lot of variation (geographic, time, etc.)
  - What’s a greeting?
    - Malinowski - an example of phatic communion
    - Wittgenstein - an example of “language game”
    - Austin - a type of performative verb
    - Searle - a type of illocutionary act
    - Sacks - a minimal proper conversation
- Malinowski on meaning
  - Meaning is not just contained in an utterance, it is tied to the context of situation
  - Collect information on culturally meaningful activities
  - The pragmatic use of speech is its primary meaning (= function)
  - “We paddle in place”
    - “paddle” describes the immediate proximity to the village of the speaker’s destination
    - “to paddle” means to arrive at the overseas village
  - Pragmatic power of words
    - Realizes this is the most important thing about speech
    - Is prevalent in all societies
  - Zeitgeist - spirit of the time/era
    - Certain ideas pop up around the same time in different places
- J. L. Austin
  - Traditionally, logicians talk about “statements”
    - If 1 and 2 are true, then 3 is true → 2 entails 3
    - Notion of truth very important for logicians
  - Describes cases where sentences/utterances look like statements, but do more than inform the listener
    - Can’t be verified as true or false
  - Statements to do not actually state - the uttering of the sentence is the doing of an action
    - “I do” in the context of marriage, naming a ship, nominating someone in a will, betting, etc. - formulas in rituals
    - Performative sentence/utterance = performative
      - The issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action
    - Uttering is not the only thing necessary for an act to be performed
      - Appropriate circumstances are necessary
      - Words must be spoken seriously/in good faith
  - How many types of speech acts?
    - 5 classes of performative verbs (also postulated by John Searle - student)
      - Used in syntactic form “I `<verb>`”
      - Assertives - assert, claim, affirm, state, deny, etc.
      - Directives - direct, request, ask, urge, tell, etc.
      - Expressives - apologize, thank, condole, congratulate, complain, etc.
      - Declaratives - declare, resign, adjourn, appoint, nominate, etc.
      - Commissives - commit, promise, threaten, vow, pledge
    - All verbs are performatives, even stating something is an act
    - Ludwig Wittgenstein also thought utterances are acts, stated there were countless types
      - Ideas were around, not necessarily in unison
  - Idea of performative verbs in line with Malinowski’s view of language as social action
    - Captured in different disciplines (anthropologist vs. philosophy)
- Malinowski on greetings
  - If language use is a mode of action, what is the action of a greeting>
    - Greetings are an example of phatic communion - establishing/maintaining contact
  - What people say is not actually that important
  - The important part is that interaction is happening
  - Is there content in a greeting?
    - “Good morning” - there is no new information, so what are the speakers doing?
- Austin on greetings
  - Classified as behabitives
    - Together with apologies, thanks, sympathy, etc.
    - Student John Searle calls them expressives
  - Behabatives
    - Include the notion of reaction to other people’s behavior and fortunes and of attitudes and expressions of attitudes to someone else’s past conduct or imminent conduct
  - Expressives
    - The pragmatic goal of expressives is to express the psychological state specified in the sincerity condition about a state of affairs specified in the propositional content
- Conversation analysis
  - Group of sociologists in the 1960s started to study spontaneous conversations as forms of social organization
  - Showed remarkable regularities in the ways conversations are structured, turn-taking rules, pauses/overlaps, and repair mechanisms for self/other correcting
  - Greetings in spontaneous interaction
- Harvey Sacks
  - Greetings are ahistorically relevant (no matter your history, greetings are necessary)
  - Greetings occur at the beginning of a conversation
  - Greetings identify the category “proper conversationalists”
    - If you make a greeting, you can have a conversation
  - There are greeting substitutes
  - Greetings are typically a sequence of 2+ turns
  - If you are not a possible asker of how are you?, you should not ask
  - The responder needs to control their answer, lying is a solution
- Not all greetings are about health
- Duranti - 6 features of greetings
  - Near-boundary occurrence
    - At the beginning of the interaction
  - Establishment of a shared perceptual field
    - People are physically near each other
  - Adjacency pair format
    - Expected to be a 2-way interaction, with the first person inciting a response from another
  - Relative predictability of form and content
  - Implicit establishment of a spatio-temporal unit of interaction
  - Identification of the interlocutor as a party worth recognition

## **Lecture 6: Formal Speech Events**

- Overall goal: to understand some features of public events and their language
- An anthropological technique
  - Transform the strange into familiar and the familiar into strange → change perspective
  - Difficult but necessary task for an anthropological understanding of human practices, customs, beliefs, and sentiments
  - Reflect back on ourselves, see the familiar become strange
- Properties of Formality
  - Increased code structuring
    - Restrictions on what you can do
      - Physical movements, postures, gestures, pitch/loudness of talk, content and interaction of talk, coordination between channels/media/modes, turn-taking, audience, applause
    - There are a limited number of ways to do a particular activity
  - Code consistency
    - Features remain the same across the speech event
    - Don’t alternate speech levels
    - Avoid mixing languages, pronunciation, volume, intonation, style of delivery, etc.
    - Code - any sign system
  - Positional, public identities are invoked
    - Ex) Professor → student relationship
    - Other sides of the identity are blocked out
    - People are introduced or talked about in terms of their role(s) in institutions
    - Use of titles (professor, doctor, etc.)
  - Central focus
    - Everyone pays attention to particular speaker/performer/performance
      - Front stage vs. backstage
    - Side-activities are reduced or conventionally ignored
- 2 more concepts
  - Performance
    - Idea that performance is a mode of spoken verbal communication
    - Take responsibility to an audience
    - Responsibility to communicative competence
    - “Assumption of accountability to an audience for the way in which communication is carried out, above and beyond its referential content”
  - Speech event
    - Can be thought of as a unit of analysis
    - You can take anything and analyze it as a speech event → analyze it in terms of speech
- Why these features in large public events
  - Hypothesis 1: establish predictability and favor coordination among individuals and groups in joint activities
  - Hypothesis 2: formulaic, consistent, routine, predictable behavior provides control over unpredictable variation that might lead to mishaps, glitches, breakdowns, embarrassment, offense, conflict, etc.
- Formality “leaks”
  - Austin used the notion of a misfire for cases in which a speech act doesn’t perform what is supposed to
  - Even in highly formal speech events, things can go wrong
  - What do we learn from such cases?
- The Creative-Formulaic Continuum
  - Creative, unknown, unpredictable, informal, improvised → formulaic, known, predictable, formal, planned
- How much room do formal events have for variation and improvisation?

## **Lecture 7: Indexicality**

- The Problem of Context
  - Malinowski said we need to pay attention to the “context of situation”, but how do we know what the “context” is?
  - The context of an utterance fluctuates, expands, and retracts
  - There is a constant battle over the control of the context and ways to connect to it
    - In terms of people communicating, interpretation of the context, etc.
  - This is made apparent in the use of deictics
    - One kind of a more general class of signs, called indexes, that can only be understood in context
    - In some cases, context creating
    - Due to dependence on context, indexes are inherently vague
      - Multiple interpretations
    - Call for collaboration and alignment
    - Can be a source of misunderstanding
  - Is ubiquitous and hidden
  - Key question: what is happening next/who is next?
- Deictics - a subset of indexes
  - A special set of words, which all languages have to a different extent and level of complexity, that need reference to the context of situation in order to be appropriately interpreted
    - By themselves ambiguous or vague
    - English deictics include:
      - Temporal adverbs like now, then, soon, latter, yesterday, today, tomorrow, etc.
      - Spatial adverbs like here, there, left, right, behind, below, etc.
      - Demonstratives like this, that, these, those, etc.
      - Personal pronouns like I, me, you, we, they, them, etc.
  - Demonstrative pronouns
    - “call upon the hearer to use his powers of observation, and so establish a connection his mind and the object”
    - “connection” is a key word for what indexes do
- C.S. Pierce’s 3 kinds of signs
  - Icon - convey ideas of the things they represent simply by imitation
  - Index - show something about things on account of their being physically connected with them
    - Refers to an object not so much because of any similarity, but because of its dynamic, spatial connection with the individual object and with the person it’s directed towards
    - Come in all varieties: specific expressions (deictics), familiar questions, traces of past/current/future events
  - Symbol - have become associated with meaning by convention/repeated usage
- Combinations
  - Can 2 or all 3 signs be combined?
  - Can something be iconic, indexing, and symbolic?

## **Lecture 8: Recognition and Code Switching**

- What do greetings do?
  - For Malinowski, they establish/maintain contact (Phatic communion) but are not for expressing ideas/reflections
  - For Sacks they identify proper conversationalists
  - For Duranti they establish a shared perceptual field, define a unit of interaction, and identify the interlocutor as worthy of recognition
- Unit of interaction: a social situation
  - An environment of mutual monitoring possibilities
  - The individuals are accountable for what they’re doing
- How is presence established?
- The Dramaturgical Metaphor
  - Talkers don’t provide information → they give shows
  - Even in the most ordinary moments, we’re acting our persona
- Social situations where stratification is foregrounded
  - In certain social situations, differential status can be communicated by how one is greeted or whether one is greeted at all
  - Some participants are recognized and others are not → they remain in the background
- Social situations where egalitarian relations are foregrounded
  - In some situations, participants might go out of their way to greet participants who are not fully competent at performing certain types of greetings
- Bailey’s study in LA
  - Daily service encounters between AA customers and Korean retailers/store owners
  - Acts of recognition
    - 2 ways of acknowledging the worth of the other
      - By explicitly acknowledging your presence with positive affect, expressing appreciation, approval, situation-specific status or role, subordination, or solidarity with the other
      - By displaying restraint, by avoiding imposing on the other (making yourself interactionally invisible)
  - Bailey proposed 2 types of politeness
    - Involvement politeness - socially expanded service encounters
    - Restrained politeness - socially minimal encounters
  - Hypothesis - when a member of a group that practices involvement politeness encounters a member of a group that practices restrained politeness, problems can arise
    - Non-conforming behavior can be interpreted as impolite, feeds into a negative stereotype of the other
    - “Crosstalk”
- Code switching
  - Intersentential - between sentences
  - Intrasentential - within the same sentence

## **Lecture 9: Ethnographic Methods**

- Ethnography
  - Writing down (fixing, inscribing) culture, e.g., in “fieldnotes”, transcripts, images, film/videos
    - Take advantage of static nature of writing in history
    - Makes you notice things you haven’t noticed before
    - Makes you aware of certain things
  - Participant observation
    - Bottom line: you go to a place and you observe
    - Learn from being there
    - Difficult to be in the place without being a part of the scene → the more you’re there, the more you impact the environment
  - Asking questions
    - “Why” questions difficult
    - Lean towards open-ended questions
  - Interviewing
  - Producing “annotated transcripts”
- Some general principles of research
  - We never get to the ultimate, exhaustive, perfect understanding of anything
    - We follow certain standards and we are open to improving on them
    - Always a different point of view
  - We have methods that give us knowledge of all kinds of phenomena and on the basis of them, we make generalizations and, in some cases, predictions
    - If we make our methods and results explicit, others can check to see whether they make the same observations
    - They might also have other hypotheses to explain the same phenomena
- Change of paradigm
  - In the past, ethnographies were meant to be as comprehensive as possible
  - Today, ethnographers tend to focus on narrower, specific cultural activities, groups, or experiences within a given community
    - Activities - working, playing, class, eating, drinking together, chatting, ceremonies/rituals, religious events, etc.
    - Groups - men, women, both, teams, classmates, playmates, working team, artists, policemen, etc.
    - Individual experience - migrating, learning a new job, illness, learning a language, traveling, meeting people, being arrested, losing a job, etc.
  - Examples:
    - 13 months in Samoa as part of a team lead by Elinor Ochs on language acquisition and socialization
    - Literacy practices in Samoan families living in Southern California
    - A political campaign for the US Congress in the 22nd district in California
    - Acquisition of jazz aesthetics, improvisation in music and talk
- Walls, living, family
  - What is a “house”, “dwelling”, “home”?
  - What does “living” mean?
  - What does “family” mean?
- Observer’s effects in other fields
  - The Observer’s Paradox is not unique to the study of human beings
  - To measure the pressure of a tire, we let some air out, thereby changing the pressure
  - The mercury-in glass thermometer produces or absorbs thermal energy and thereby changes the temperature of the body
  - In quantum mechanics, the measurement of certain phenomena can change due to what is used to measure them
- The “law” in “traditional” societies
  - There is a long tradition of anthropological studies of how non-Western societies handle violations of local norms and serious crimes (the field is called “legal anthropology”)
  - In linguistic anthropology, there have been studies of events where the community addresses conflicts about properties and rights (e.g, over land, labor, kinship, inheritance) or acts of physical aggression
- Hierarchical (stratified) vs. Egalitarian societies
  - This distinction was an important one in the anthropology of the 20th century
  - “Hierarchal” or “stratified” was used for societies where there are status or rank distinctions among members, e.g., some individuals hold “titles” of various importance that give them right over land, labor force, and the products of labor
    - Age, gender, personal prestige, etc.
  - “Egalitarian” refers to societies where there are no distinctions of status or rank except for age, gender, and personal prestige

## **Lecture 10: Death Penalty in the US**

- Ethics in research
  - The Observer’s Paradox cannot be easily avoided
  - All research protocols must be subject to a peer-review process that conforms to federal regulations aimed at ensuring that people’s rights are not violated during research
  - Certain groups (children, incarcerated people, mentally disabled people, etc.) are considered vulnerable populations and their study requires special approval to make sure they will be protected and not negatively affected
- 3 key questions in a research project
  - What - the phenomenon
  - Why - the possible causes, motivations, conditions, contexts
  - How - the methods used to describe the what and find the why
- Conley’s death penalty study in Texas
  - How - “Texas jurors have sentenced capital defendants to death 80% of the time”
    - Study how jurors come to their decision
  - Some starting questions:
    - How can human beings sentence another person to die?
    - What is the role of language in this process?
    - How is language a form of violence?
    - How does the death penalty fit with democratic notion of justice?
    - How much does the public know about the process whereby someone is sentenced to death?
  - Premise: visibility of the phenomenon
    - “the system and implementation of the death penalty in the United States remains to a large degree hidden from the population. Indeed ... argues that the ‘survival of capital punishment in the United States depends, in part, on its relative invisibility’” (Conley)
  - Some facts:
    - The US Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty does not violate the 8th amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment
      - 21 states and the DoC have abolished the death penalty, while 29 states still retain it
    - Governors have place moratoriums on the use of the death penalty in Oregon, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and California, but the laws have not changed
    - There are 5 methods of execution in the US: lethal injection, electrocution, lethal gas, hanging, and firing squad
    - Bench trials and jury trials
      - In criminal matters, if the punishment could be greater than 6 months in prison, the defendant is entitled to a trial by a jury of their peers
      - In Federal court, the right to a jury trial in a civil matter exists for any controversy where the amount involved is greater than $20
        - This right applies to both the plaintiff and the defendant, and if either party requests a jury, it will be provided
    - Issues with principles and procedures
      - Between 1967-1977, executions in the US were halted as evidence of racial injustice and arbitrariness in the use of the death penalty mounted
      - When most states revised their capital punishment laws, the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976, but this approval inaugurated a new period of experimentation regarding the application of the death penalty
      - In the eyes of many, that experiment has failed to meet even the minimal standards of fairness and justice
  - The Process
    - Voir dire - prosecutor and defense attorney interview potential jurors to assess whether they can be impartial
    - Jurors are asked to put emotions aside, asked whether they think they will be able to be objective
  - Questions
    - Jurors were asked 2 questions, which will be consequential for their decision about whether to give life without parole or the death penalty
      - Future danger question - do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?
      - Mitigation question - do you find that the evidence, taking into consideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offence, the defendant’s character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant, that there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed?
    - A death sentence must be unanimous, while a life sentence requires only 10 votes
    - In case of a hung jury, a life sentence is issued
  - Ethnography methods
    - Participant observation → field notes
    - Whose perspective? (defendants, lawyers, prosecutors, victims’ family)
    - Interviews → open-ended questions
    - Analyzed jurors’ narrative, statements, descriptions of their feelings

## **Lecture 11: Empathy and Personal Reference**

- Why is it difficult to look at certain photos or at certain scenes of a movie?
  - Violent, graphic, visceral, etc. describe the object of our reaction
- Definition by Edith Stein - Empathy is our (natural) way of experiencing others by identification with their experience, different from perception or memory
- Empathy
  - From Greek empatheia
  - In Ancient Greek pathos literally meant “what happens to a person”
    - Good or bad experience
    - From that it came to also mean emotion/passion
  - English is the translation of the German Einfühlung
    - Describes our capacity to experience what someone else is experiencing
  - Infants are distressed by the distress of others and may cry
  - Some animals are also distressed by the suffering of other animals
- Hypothesis about Empathy
  - Empathy is pre-reflexive - immediate and not brought about by reasoning
    - Said to work from analogy - we compare self and other
  - Recently supported by research on mirror neurons that demonstrated that when we observe someone else’s actions, the same neurons that are activated in the other person are activated in us
- Empathy, affect encoded in languages
  - In some languages, there are specific words or grammatical forms that encode or trigger empathy
  - This is a conventional and hence “cultural” way of triggering or responding to something
  - What’s done with grammatical parts like special pronouns or special articles can be done in other ways - lexically, prosodically, paralinguistically
- Deixis
  - Demonstrative: this, that, these, those, etc.
  - Adverbs: here, there, now, yesterday, etc.
  - Personal pronouns: I, you, etc.
  - Deictic + Noun: this table, that man, etc.
- Third Person Reference, Common Nouns
  - Man, woman, gentleman, lady
  - Mom, mommy, dad, daddy
  - Young man, boy, young woman, girl
- 1st and 2nd vs. 3rd person
  - For Emile Benveniste, the 3rd person is a non-person, someone excluded from the speaker-hearer special relationship
  - “They” are the ones who are not spoken to, but spoken about
- Negative Affect, Distancing vis Pronouns and Deictics
  - White residents talking about Asian American “newcomers”
    - “I welcome them to our community, but it is them coming to our community. I don’t want it to change into their community.”
    - “What do you know about these people?”
- Review
  - Empathy is a pan-human, natural response to events that evoke immediate and unconscious emotional reactions
  - Is empathy also cultural?
  - Can it be manipulated, evoked?
    - Language can be used for this
  - Does communication have a role in evoking empathy, identification vs. emotional distance?

## **Lecture 12: Agency, Intentionality, Responsibility**

- Objectivity
  - Is objectivity possible? What is it?
  - Subjective vs. objective
    - Subjective - point of view of an individual
    - Objective must have a separation from the subject
  - Intersubjective - between subjects
    - Talks about the existential condition
    - Existence of humans in a community
    - Notion of who we are is in the context of how others see us
  - Bracketing and suspension of judgement
    - Suspension of judgement is generally not natural
    - Suspension of judgement is sometimes necessary for certain tasks
- Reading Emotions
  - Important point for an anthropological understanding of this kind of situation is not whether the defendant was feeling no emotion/remorse
    - Not something that can be investigated objectively
  - Instead, investigate the noticing of particular behaviors by the defendant by particular individuals, and the effect these behaviors have on the opinions of the jury
  - Suspend questions in mind about the defendant → question observations/use of language
- What can we learn from languages?
  - Grammarians are interested in what sentences reveal about what a human language can be like, what they encode, how they form sentences, etc.
    - Also interested in how to represent native speakers knowledge of the grammar (grammatical competence) through categorization
  - Linguistic anthropologists are interested in what utterances, specific words, and grammar reveal about the speakers’ beliefs, attitudes, social world, emotions, and ethics
- Agency
  - One of the ways in which people represent their understanding of a situation or event is in their encoding of agency
    - Who did what to whom
    - Says something about the speaker, indexing their stance towards events or people
    - Can also affect how the listeners or readers understand the events and protagonists being described
- Definition of agency
  - Entities have agency if they:
    - Have some degree of control over their own behavior
    - Engage in actions that affect other entities
    - Are evaluated from a practical, aesthetic, and moral point of view for what they do and how they do it
      - The moral point of view implies responsibility

## **Lecture 13: Narrating the Self**

- What makes humans different?
  - Social organization?
  - Culture?
  - Language?
  - Morality?
  - Reflexivity?
    - Knowing we are mortal?
    - Knowing what we know?
    - Knowing that we can lie?
    - Wondering about the meaning of life?
  - Constantly find contradictory evidence to our answers
- We “measure” our life with language
  - Construction of a self
  - Existential dilemmas in narratives of personal experience
  - Coherence vs. authenticity
    - Coherence - constructing a story
    - Authenticity - sound real, unique/give value while being true to ourselves
  - Existential coherence - in telling a story, we are trying to recreate a coherence of our own existence
  - Radical reflexivity about who I should be and who I want to be
    - Does this image mesh with your actions
- Connecting with audience
  - To explain who we are, we need to connect to our audience, for them to take our point of view, we need to show we can take their point of view
  - Recipient Design - you shape how you talk to the subject of your speech
    - Referents are identified as relevant to the context
    - Taking the point of view of the recipient/listener and the ongoing activity
- Grammar: tense and aspect in English
  - Past tense
  - Historical present
  - Present perfect
  - Past perfect
  - Present progressive
  - Past progressive

## **Lecture 14: Language Socialization**

- Goal: to understand language acquisition from an ethnographic and cross-cultural perspective
- Themes and Concepts
  - Language acquisition vs. socialization
  - Notion of “simplified register”
  - Notion of “mediated activity”
  - Notion of “Baby Talk” and its non-universality
  - Notion of “adaptation”
- Language Acquisition or Development
  - The study of how children come to acquire the language spoken by adults and other children in their environment
  - It is seen as connected with or part of cognitive development
  - Includes the notion of stages of acquisition, the acquisition of grammatical categories, sentence types, speech acts, politeness, etc.
  - Until the 1970s, almost exclusively done in relation to European languages
- Language Socialization
  - Based on the notion of communicative competence
  - 2 meanings of language socialization:
    - Socialization into language → to become competent speakers/hearers of a language, to know how and when to use it to do what
    - Socialization through language → language is used to socialize children to become particular kinds of persons
- Baby Talk
  - 3 questions:
    - What is Baby Talk? (Data)
    - How do we study it? (Methods)
    - Why Baby Talk? (Theory)
  - 2 approaches:
    - Linguistics - Baby Talk is a simplified register and seems universal
    - Linguistic anthropology - Baby Talk is part of a set of strategies for socialization and is not universal
  - Features of Baby Talk
    - Greater redundancy
    - Slower speech
    - More careful articulation
    - Lengthening of sounds
    - Repetition
    - Paraphrases of ambiguous phrases
    - Expansion of child’s utterances
    - Special rules (baby hungry, mommy here)
    - Special names
    - Different word accent
    - Simplification of consonant clusters
- A “Simplified Register”
  - A way or style of talking that is designed for interlocutors who are considered not fully competent
  - Baby talk, foreigner talk, etc.
  - Simplified registers can also be seen as examples of recipient design
  - Speakers adapt to their idea of what the hearer-recipient can understand
  - Speakers’ ideas about language and language use are called their language ideology
- A “Mediated Activity”
  - A simplified register, like any type of talk, can also be analyzed as one of the 3 elements of a mediated activity
  - Y mediates between A and B
  - Language mediates between A and B
  - Native speaker and Foreign speaker → mediate with foreign talk or native talk?
- Language socialization claims 2 basic strategies
  - Adapt situation to child
    - Simplified register → Baby Talk
    - Cooperative building of utterances between caregiver and child
    - Caregiver follows child’s topic
    - Typical participation format: 2 party (dyadic) interactions
  - Adapt child to situation
    - Modelling of unsimplified utterances
    - Child directed to notice others
    - Topics arise from context controlled by caregiver
    - Typical participation format: multiparty interactions
- Mother-Child interaction in a Samoan village
  - Child appeals High Caregiver
  - Low caregiver directed to, satisfies the child
- Language acquisition is embedded in cultural practices, that is, routine interactions in the lived space informed by beliefs and expectations
- Main points
  - Child discourse has been studied with different methods
  - Each method uncovers different aspects of a child’s world and different properties of language
  - Language socialization sees talk as part of a larger set of strategies

## **Lecture 15: Family Narratives**

- Topics:
  - The concepts of "narrative"
  - Different methods of study
  - Analytic categories, parts of narratives, types of narrative, types of participants
- 4 Traditions of Study of Oral Narratives
  - Folklore and performance studies
  - Grammar in discourse, narrative syntax
  - Conversation analysis
  - Language socialization
- Labov's Categories
  - Abstract - what the story's going to be about
  - Orientation - setting
  - Complicating action - the unfolding of the story
  - Evaluation - the narrator steps back and portrays himself outside of the context of the story
  - Resolution - end
  - Coda (optional)
- Different Kinds of Narratives
  - Reports: temporal sequence, past oriented, no causal sequence
  - Stories of personal experience: a problem-centered past-time narrative, oriented toward solving some aspect of the narrated events
  - Agendas: temporal sequence without causal links, future-oriented
  - Plans: temporal and causal sequence, future-oriented
  - Reports and agendas articulate a temporal sequence of events but do not organize physical states, thoughts, emotions, and/or actions as outcomes or responses to a pivotal, unexpected precipitating event
- Stories of Personal Experience
  - The narrative contains at least 2 temporally ordered clauses referring to at least 2 past-time events
  - The narrative centers around a past event - often referred to as the 'inciting event' or 'initiating event' that is presented as inciting an internal/psychological or external/physical response or condition
    - The initiating or inciting event roughly corresponds to the 'complicating action' of a narrative of personal experience described by Labov and Waletzky
- Ochs and Taylor's Analytic Categories
  - Protagonist - leading character, present or absent, in a narrated event
  - Introducer - co-narrator who initiates the narrative (elicitor or initial teller)
  - Primary recipient - the co-narrator(s) to whom the narrative is not just told, but "oriented" (family judge role)
  - Problematizer - co-narrator who problematizes the action, thought, feeling of the protagonist
  - Problematizee - co-narrator whose actions, thoughts, etc. are rendered problematic
- The "Father Knows Best" Dynamic
  - "Within this dynamic, the father is typically set up - through his own and others' recurrent narrative practices - to be primary audience, judge, and critic of family members' actions, conditions, thoughts, and feelings as narrative protagonists (actors in the past) or as co-narrators (actors in the present)"
  - "... the women as mothers and wives that contribute to this dynamic, instantiating and modeling in their conduct as narrators a pervasive orientation toward fathers as evaluators" (Ochs & Taylor)
- Context and Identities
  - Does it make a difference if you know the identities of the speakers and the context of the interaction?
    - What do we learn about narratives?
    - What do we learn from analyzing narratives

## **Lecture 16: Habitus**

- Warning:
  - Some of the concepts for this week are very complex and the language used to describe them is often difficult to understand
  - Bourdieu's writing style doesn't help make it easier
  - The phenomena that Bourdieu is trying to capture in both the world and about the world should become clearer with some examples
- Today:
  - Introduction to the notion of "habitus"
    - Relation between "habitus" and practice
  - What we call "structure" is the result of a "doing"
    - Knowledge is not a thing but a process, hence mutable, variable, reshaped in unfolding everyday actions or, better, interactions
  - On Wednesday, the question will be: can habitus be changed?
- Bourdieu (1977)
  - Bourdieu borrows from the phenomenological literature to uncover how the object of social science and the regularities captured by statistical methods are the product of practices, which are taken for granted
  - Both Subject and Object are acknowledged and, most importantly, their ongoing dialectics
  - Habitus substitutes consciousness, motivation, knowledge, etc.
- Why "habitus"?
  - Bourdieu wants to overcome the separation in science between the (acting/investigating) Subject (often hidden in the analysis) and the Object (the result of the analysis)
  - He criticizes objectivism
    - We think we're separate from what we're studying
    - What appears objective is the product of a modus operandi (way of doing things) of which the Agent is not conscious
- Dialectic relation
  - The subject studying the object has subjective motivations
  - The object (social reality, institutions)
  - Habitus <--> structures
  - Ex) school system as a structure/institution is the outcome of a dialectics of individuals' dispositions and institutional requirements/goals realized through practices (ways of being and doing)
    - Are our goals?
    - We project ourselves into a future defined by our experiences
- The "commonsense world"
  - The habitus produces a "commonsense world" that appears as a reality separate from the Subject (or Agent)
  - Bourdieu is skeptical of the individual's intentions as separate from the habitus ("the harmony of ethos and taste") as dispositions that are acquired, practiced, and reproduced within a group
- Different attitudes toward our "world"
  - "the natural attitude" - the unmarked, default way of being in the world, including a practical engagement
  - Examples of other attitudes:
    - "theoretical attitude"
    - "aesthetic attitude"
    - "the arithmetic attitude"
- Thesis: the "natural" is "cultural"
  - How do we go about uncovering the "cultural" side of looking at the world and being in the world?
  - 2 concept tools to think with: habitus and aspect
- Habitus = "condition, state, dress, demeanor, character, etc."
  - In using language
  - In using tools
  - Ways of seeing, hearing, feeling, etc.
  - Being with others
- Latin habitus
  - From the verb habeo 'to have'
- Bourdieu's use of Greek notion of hexis
  - Speaks directly to motor function
  - "in all societies, children are particularly attentive to the gestures and postures which, in their eyes, express everything that goes to make an accomplished adult"
    - Children are looking at you all the time, absorbing information
    - Imitation leads to success
    - The knowledge of how to do things physically is embodied within you

- Habitus implies:
  - Constraints (how, where, with whom to do `X`, etc.)
  - Structure (does it produce/support a "structure", a pattern, a predictable activity, e.g., a ritual, an institution?)
  - History (have these people done it before, how do we know?)
  - Competence (do they show they have a "feel for the game")
  - Are they following a rule? Improvising?
- Improvisation and corporeality
  - "a theory of habitus is incomplete without a notion of structure that makes room for the organized improvisation of agents. to understand this 'social art' of improvisation consists of, we need to turn to Bourdieu's social ontology"

## **Lecture 17: Aspect Seeing and Professional Vision**

- Today:
  - "Seeing as" - aspect seeing
  - Filling in the missing information
    - Doing it right and doing it wrong
  - Socializing an audience to see in a professional way

- Mind, Body, Umwelt
  - The notion of habitus brings up the question of the habitual ways we know things, places, people
  - How do we know, or how do we get to know?
    - Through an interplay of the sense, our memory, our cultural understanding/interpretation (schemata, concepts, language)
- "Seeing as"
  - We don't just see, we see as
- L. Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations
  - The word see has 2 uses:
    - What do you see there? - I see this
    - I see a likeness between these 2 faces
  - "I contemplate a face, and then suddenly notice its likeness to another. I see that it has not changed, and yet I see it differently. I call this experience 'noticing an aspect'"
  - "So we interpret it, and see it as we interpret it"
  - Duck-rabbit
    - "I must distinguish between the continuous seeing of an aspect and the dawning of an aspect"
  - "We become conscious of the aspect only when it changes. As when someone is conscious only of a change of note, but doesn't have absolute pitch"
  - "If there were no change of aspect then there would only be a way of taking, and no such thing as seeing this or that"
  - "If there were only one substance, there would be no use for the word substance ... The concept 'substance' presupposes the concept 'difference in substance'"
- Filling in
  - Expectations guide our perception
  - Our everyday of being in the world requires us to fill in the missing parts, to have imagination
  - We add what is not "there" - the phantom - (what we don't see or don't hear but "should be there" or what someone else = or us at a different time/place - would see)
- "Seeing as" = constituting
  - The audience sees Betty's actions as "being funny". Dunaway sees him as "being impossible"
  - Faye Dunaway sees the card as the "Best Picture" Card, i.e., sees the wrong card as the right card
- Can Habitus be changed?
  - Primary and secondary socialization (schooling)
  - Acquiring a professional way of:
    - Seeing
    - Hearing/Listening
    - Feeling (by touch, by emotion)
    - Tasting
    - Smelling
- "Seeing as" in a court case
  - Charles Goodwin's analysis of the first trial of 4 police officers accused of use of excessive force against motorist Rodney King
  - Main piece of evidence = video recording made amateur video photographer
    - Graphic violence is shown
    - Conviction was expected
    - The tape was seen as "objective"
  - Seeing as excessive use of force vs. proper response
    - To develop a "professional vision" means to be able to see as an archaeologist or ... as a policeman
    - The video tape as evidence of?
      - Hitting Rodney King seen as police brutality, violence vs. seen as legitimate, appropriate response
    - Through a coding scheme (de-escalation) to King's actions (escalation)
  - A "coding scheme"
    - "the tools that Sergeant Koon had available to him on March 3rd ... a metal baton ... is a tool ... to protect yourself"
  - Seeing aggression vs. cooperation
    - Body movements of King visible on the video tape are coded as either "cooperative" or "aggressive"
    - Small moments are situated within a prospective horizon, using present progressive, e.g., "starting to"
    - Control of the perceptual field
  - Showing aggression visually
    - From video tape to blown up, still images
    - Use of highlighting to enhance objects, people, details
      - To stretch, slow down time
    - The officer who was shown pressing his knee on George Floyd's neck for 8:46 has been charged for second-degree manslaughter
      - The video of this act is the main evidence - taken as a "fact" and "objective"
      - But, there will be interpretations, there will be seeing as, and there will be context added
    - Truth is mediated by language and actions, and what is known or shared cannot be taken for granted
- Culture and communication mediate truth
  - That does not mean that "truth" does not exist, but that it is part of a process, a negotiation of perspectives, a coming together, or staying apart
  - Truth is never obvious
    - It takes work to uncover, check, understand
    - It's a test for individuals and community
