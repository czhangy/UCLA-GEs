## Reading 1: Why Study the Greeks?

- Cultures in Dialogue
  - Modern thinking pulls democracy, medicine, architecture, astronomy, ethics, poetry, dance, mathematics, etc. from the Greeks
    - Atomic theory of Demokritos and Leukippos
    - Mathematical theorems of Euclid
    - Democracy - **demos** (people) + **kratos** (rule)
    - Concepts of truth and beauty
- Truth and Beauty
  - Beauty in poetry and sculpting
    - Homer's Iliad
    - Sculpting of limestone and marble as learned from the Egyptians
      - Took the Egyptians' work and revolutionized it with a form of naturalism
  - Plato's *Symposium* describes how "the seeker of truth will hunt for the beauty to be found in all things"
    - The seeker will find beauty in bodies and also in laws and civil institutions
  - View culture in contrast to modern day pop culture
    - Shows us a battle between thoughtful, ethical engagement with the world and bland superficiality
      - Significance vs. triviality
    - Knowing the Greeks better = knowing ourselves better
  - **kore** - statue of a young woman
  - Ancient works compel us to ask questions of a strange, yet recognizable society
  - Greeks stand at the head of Western culture
    - Greeks are a model of perfection
    - We have a real and tangible connection to them, but it must be scrutinized
- Democracy, Ancient and Modern
  - In our world, democracy takes two forms: parliamentary and presidential
    - Franchise extends to both men and women 18+, citizens elect governments to represent them, and governments are answerable to the people
  - Greek democracy has its differences
    - No women
    - Foreigners given little chance to participate
    - Structure founded on slaves giving citizens the opportunity to participate
    - Male citizens voted in the **Ekklesia**, an Athenian assembly that voted on matters such as public contracts, taxes, and declarations of war
      - Direct democracy
      - Members of the **Boule** were elected representatives of their tribe at random, served for 1 year, and then couldn't serve again for 10
    - Athenians were the government
      - Government was not separate from the people
    - Denounced in that it favored the poor, not the higher class members of Greek society
  - Free societies are capable of the highest aspirations, but must confront their own shortcomings
    - Experience the tension between altruistic aspirations and conspicuous failures
    - Failure leads to the unveiling of social tension
      - The plague in Ancient Greece vs. Hurricane Katrina today
- Greek Architecture and Philosophy
  - Hard to imagine the Western world finding its expressions for power and national identity without the model of the Greeks
  - Orders of Greek architecture: Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian
  - Architectural vocabulary is derived from the styles and forms of the Greeks
  - Emphasizes the motifs of similarity and difference in our relationship with the Greeks
  - Western philosophy builds off of the work of the Greeks
    - Works are however outdated
      - Plato and Aristotle's work on slavery
      - Modern societies have to work with the elitist thinking of the Greeks when it comes to topics such as slavery and women's rights
- East versus West?
  - The championing of the Greeks results in the mindset that Western civilization is superior
    - The post-WWI state of the Middle East acts as a footnote in Western history, but is vastly significant to those in the Middle East (9/11)
  - We take on an obligation to understand the origin of our own societies before we continue to repeat mistakes of the past
    - Greeks vs. Persia
  - The defeat of Leonidas at Thermopylae is an example of the victors romanticizing the war, altering historical perspective
  - We have inherited the Western stereotype of "the Eastern other" from the Greeks
- Paideia
  - All study of history feeds historical consciousness and helps us better understand our societies
    - The Greeks are a direct view into our past, unlike China or the Maya
  - We return to the Greeks' ideals of exploring ethics honestly, debating policy vigorously, valuing beauty deeply, and acting in a spirit of generosity and civility
    - This is the Greek paideia
  - The Greeks act as a model for who we aim to be and a reminder that flawed societies can still distinguish themselves



## Summary 1: Why Study the Greeks?

- Cultures in Dialogue
  - Across a range of human activities, from medicine and architecture to poetry and mathematics, contemporary western culture reveals a powerful connection to the world of the ancient Greeks
- Truth and beauty
  - The Greeks' preoccupation with truth and beauty are particularly relevant in today's world, saturated as it is by pop culture
- Democracy, Ancient and Modern
  - The complexity of our relationship to the Greeks is conveyed by different ideas of democracy: participatory versus representative
  - The paradox of envisioning an ideal society while recognizing its flaws is another point of contact between the Greeks and us
- Greek Architecture and Philosophy
  - The tension between similarity and difference can be explored in architecture, where similar forms hide different functions
  - In philosophy, we follow paths set by the Greeks, yet in areas of human rights there are deep voids unexplored by the Greeks
- East versus West?
  - The danger of placing the Greeks on a pedestal is that it fits a western-oriented interpretation of history, denigrating other cultures as inferior
  - Modern instances of this demonizing of the Other show that ideologically freighted history remains a danger
- Paideia
  - Just as the Greeks moved towards a more inclusive notion of Greekness, replacing blood with culture, so too we face the challenge of esteeming the Greeks and understanding their accomplishments while still respecting other cultures



## Summary 2: Early Greece and the Minoans: The Labyrinth and the Minotaur

- Greece in the Neolithic: The Origins of Complex Societies
  - From the Franchthi Cave and a number of other sites (including Dikili Tash, Alepotrypa, Sesklo, and Dimini), a picture emerges of gradually increasing social complexity and stratification
  - Successive sites have also been identified at such places as Gournia and Pseira
- The Third Millennium
  - Complex societies appeared in a number of regions around Greece in the third millennium, notably in Attica at Tsepi, on Aegina, and on many of the islands of the Aegean
  - Particularly interesting, but somewhat enigmatic, is the Cycladic culture
- Minoan Crete
  - On Crete, a society emerged based on the great palaces of Knossos, Phaistos, and Malia
  - Palatial culture relied on a redistributive economy
  - The palaces were also religious and cultic centers
- Beyond the Palaces
  - In other parts of Crete, smaller settlements have also been identified at places, such as Gournia and Pseira.
  - Outside Crete, Minoan culture is also on display as far away as Lemnos and Thera
  - Cretan-style bull-jumping is also evident at Avaris in Egypt
- Thera: A Minoan Settlement
  - The richest evidence for Minoan culture and daily life in the Bronze Age comes from Thera
  - Wall paintings reveal a vivid appreciation of nature. Some scenes may also depict naval expeditions, calling to mind Homer's poems
- The End of Minoan Culture
  - The theory that Minoan culture was destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption is assessed
  - Gradual incursion by Mycenaean elements is also examined a possible explanation for the end of Minoan culture
- Interpreting the Past
  - The role of Sir Arthur Evans and the practice of restoration is examined
  - How we imagine the past plays a key role in how we interpret the past



## Summary 3: Mycenae: Rich in Gold

- Schliemann and the Creation of the Bronze Age
  - An obsessive but unscrupulous man, Schliemann uncovered the sites of Troy and Mycenae but left a legacy of dishonesty that raises a question mark over his discoveries
  - Even so, he gave Homer's poems a material context, increasing the likelihood of an historical kernel to the poems
- The Origins of the People of the Shaft Graves
  - The wealth of Mycenae, rich in gold, raises questions regarding the origins of Late Bronze Age Mycenaean culture
  - Some scholars think Mycenaean mercenary were employed by Pharaoh
  - Recent studies point toward trade connections with the Danube basin
- The Mycenaean World
  - The physical remains at Mycenae point to a warrior aristocracy whose power was expressed in monumental architecture: massive walls, imposing relief sculpture, and impressive corbeled tombs
  - Recent work also shows that the citadel was surrounded by a larger settlement
  - Linear B tablets allow us to recreate the highly centralized production, storage and distribution characteristic of the Mycenaean economy
- Mycenaean Knossos
  - Linear B evidence also fits with mythical traditions regarding the relations of Mycenae and Crete in the late Bronze Age
  - The final phase of complex palatial life at Knossos was dominated by Mycenaeans from the mainland
- Troy and Homer
  - The relationship between archaeological evidence and literary evidence is most acute in the so-called Homeric question: do the Homeric poems accurately reveal the world of the Bronze Age, and are the poems' descriptions of the Trojan War reliable?
  - This debate turns on both the formulaic quality of Homer's poetry and the recent controversial interpretation of the material culture of Troy
- The Collapse of Mycenaean Culture
  - The end of the Bronze Age in Greece has been prompted a wide variety of explanations, from climate change to foreign invasion
  - It is likely that there was widespread upheaval around the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC
  - The collapse of Mycenaean palatial culture was symptomatic of a broader systems collapse across the Levant



## Summary 4: The Iron Age

- Center and Periphery
  - In the Iron Age, some former citadels were still occupied but new societies can be seen at such places as Lefkandi
  - At some sites, such as Kalapodi, there is evidence of continuity of cult
  - New communities were dominated by chieftains who saw Homer's heroes as models for their own authority
  - Homer's poems are not relics of the Bronze Age but represent the use of the past in shaping a new identity
- Polis and Ethnos
  - In some parts of Greece the *oikoi*, or households of the elite, coalesced to form larger communities, the first *poleis*, or city-states
  - Other regions retained more dispersed settlements and looser political bonds, identifying as *ethne*, or ethnic units, and sometimes as political federations, or *koina*
  - Temples were often the focal point of early communities. Religious authority helped stabilize these states
  - Rulers' palaces were often transformed into gods' houses
- A Greek Diaspora
  - Colonization and trade are distinctive features of the eighth and seventh centuries
  - Greeks were part of a broader Mediterranean network
  - This cultural contact exposed them to older cultures, stories, languages, and even such phenomena as writing
  - Delphi played a key role in endorsing Greek colonies
  - Indigenous populations were for the most part demonized
  - The Olympics developed at the same time, helping a Greek identity to coalesce



## Summary 5: The Archaic Age: Sparta

- Archaic Crisis
  - Increasing travel, trade, and colonization brought challenges to the Greeks of the Archaic period
  - There is evidence for the emergence of many unfree groups: essentially serfs tied to the land
  - Competition, strife, and warfare between communities were characteristic of the Archaic period
  - These tensions were only exacerbated by the introduction of coinage and the emergence of a monetized economy
- Early Sparta
  - Sparta followed a unique course of development
  - Five villages federated, but Sparta always remained spatially decentralized
  - Some religious practices suggest a strong identification with Homer's heroes and heroines, but other cult spots, such as the throne of Apollo at Amyklai, were unique
  - The conquest of neighboring Messenia put Sparta on a different path
  - Full citizens were trained as full-time warriors, supported by the labor and produce of the enslaved helots
- The Great Rhetra
  - An account of the constitution, preserved in Plutarch centuries later, records details of the Spartan system of government
  - Ultimate power lay in the hands of the people. In an important amendment, the kings and council were given veto power
  - Spartan culture was vibrant in the Archaic period but gradually lost impetus
  - The transformation of Sparta lay in the increasing focus on warfare as a permanent state of affairs
  - Sparta's relations with the neighboring states of the Peloponnese also reflect an emphasis on regional hegemony



## Summary 6: The Archaic Age: Athens

- Competition and Rivalry
  - The early Athenian state was subject to a good deal of aristocratic rivalry and violence
  - There is also evidence for many social organizations that structured the life of the Athenians in tribes, brotherhoods, clans, and households
  - The adoption of coinage was viewed with suspicion by many who saw land and aristocratic values being replaced by the desire for wealth
  - Early Athenian law also points to a society still reliant on religious and family ties to underpin state institutions
- Solon
  - When civil unrest had almost reached the level of civil war in early Athens, Solon was appointed to resolve the continuing crisis
  - He focused on relieving the burden of debt afflicting share-croppers, and instituted a "shaking off" of burdens, the *Seisachtheia*
  - He also created a new, clear system of census classifications based on wealth in order to make political participation predictable and orderly
  - Across a range of fields, from funerary legislation to the law on tyranny, Solon's legislation represents a comprehensive attempt to put the Athenians state on a secure footing
- Peisistratos
  - In the short term Solon failed, and his time in office was followed by more faction fighting.
  - Out of these regional conflicts arose Peisistratos, who ruled Athens as tyrant throughout the middle of the sixth century
  - Despite tyranny's reputation, Peisistratos had a lasting positive influence on Athens, encouraging the development of a unified Athenian identity, prosperity and stability
  - After his death his sons continued to rule with the cooperation of other leading families but were seen as harsh and ruthless, resulting in assassination of Hipparchos and the exile of Hippias
- Kleisthenes
  - As regional violence threatened once again to engulf Athens a new leader emerged: Kleisthenes
  - He proposed a radical new political system, based on an entirely new organization of the state
  - The entire region of Attica, made up of 139 demes, was divided into ten new tribes
  - Each tribe was made of three thirds, each drawn from one of the regional districts of Attica
  - The result, building on Solon's reforms and Peisistratos's stability, was to give the Athenians a solid democratic foundation for their state
  - Kleisthenes disappears from history, but thanks to his and the earlier reforms of Solon and Peisistratos, the Athenians were in a position to survive the coming Persian invasions



## Summary 7: Persia

- Greece Prior to the Persian Wars
  - Greece was part of a zone of cultural interaction that stretched across the eastern Mediterranean and beyond
  - The Greeks labeled "barbarian" those whose speech they found difficult to understand
  - The phenomenon of "Othering," or emphasizing cultural difference, is a process that would sharply increase as a result of the Persian Wars
- Persia
  - Originally a semi-nomadic people of the steppes, the Persians entered the region of Iran before 700 BC
  - The same region had been home to various early cultures, making up a patchwork of peoples and kingdoms
  - The Persians came to dominate the region during the reign of Cyrus the Elder
    - His dynasty is called Achaemenid, named after the semi-mythical founder of the dynasty, Achaemenes
- The Achaemenids  
  - Cyrus and his successors fashioned a powerful empire
    - A religion focused on the Sky God, Ahura Mazda, provided unity and underpinned the dynasty
  - The empire depended on tribute from every region, and power was often given to local governors, called satraps
  - Persepolis served as the capital and symbolic center of this vast domain
  - Darius continued the territorial expansion of the Persian empire, crossing into Europe in 513 BC
  - A revolt of the Ionian Greeks in 499 BC brought the Persians into direct conflict with the Athenians
- Greece versus Persia
  - The Persians dispatched a force in 490 BC to punish the Athenians for having participated in the Ionian revolt
    - The Persians landed at Marathon but were defeated by the Athenian army
  - In the decade that followed Darius died and was succeeded by his son, Xerxes, who planned a much larger invasion by land and by sea.
  - Xerxes' army advanced slowly but the Greek response was hesitant and poorly coordinated
    - After the Greeks withdrew from Tempe in northern Greece in 480 BC, a smaller army, led by Leonidas of Sparta, fortified the position at Thermopylae to slow the Persian advance.
  - After the death of Leonidas, his 300 Spartans, and 700 Thespians, the Greeks still debated how and where to meet the Persians
  - Athens was evacuated and sacked
  - The Greek forces took to their ships and met the Persians at Salamis, where the Greeks were victorious
  - The Great King left Greece but his army only withdrew to Central Greece to winter quarters
  - The Persians came south again in 479 BC and were defeated at the Battle of Plataia
- Aftermath
  - The Greeks continued the war against Persia
  - Offerings of thanks for the Greek victory were dedicated at Delphi
  - In the decades to come, the triumph of the Greeks often resulted in an ugly triumphalism
  - The Persians were mocked as effeminate, and the cultural production of the Golden Age, whether on stage, in writing or visually, made frequent use of xenophobic stereotypes
    - Victory had come at a cost



## Summary 8: Democracy and Empire

- Introduction: From Ruin to Recovery
  - Immediately after the Persian Wars, the Greeks went on the offensive and undertook the expulsion of the Persians from the Aegean
  - The Athenians soon took over the Greek alliance from the Spartans and began a vigorous campaign throughout the Aegean
  - Although some episodes were designed to expel the Persians, many were thinly veiled attempts to secure control of the grain route from the Black Sea to Athens
  - Within no more than a decade, the Delian League had been transformed from a free alliance into an Athenian naval empire.
- Democratic Institutions
  - As the empire flourished abroad, so did democracy at home
  - The Ekklesia was open to all male adult citizens
  - The random selection of archons by lot replaced popular election, and payment for jury service also encouraged participation in democratic government
  - The Boulê, or Council of Five Hundred, administered affairs on a daily basis
    - Annual elections and the rotation of office meant that power was spread across a broad swathe of the citizen population
  - Many boards of magistrates also serving annually similarly helped avoid the aggregation of power in the hands of a narrow clique
  - The lawcourts were looked upon as the truest indication of the broad basis of Athenian democracy
    - Massed juries exercised the power of life and death
    - Oratory, as a consequence, was a highly prized skill
- The Imperial Democracy
  - Over the course of the 5th century BC the Athenians came to rely on the empire as a source of wealth, through tribute
  - The empire depended on an apparatus of government entirely supplied by the men of Athens as administrators, tax collectors, garrison commanders, soldiers, and sailors
  - The generation of Kimon saw Persia as the enemy, but Perikles saw the rift with Sparta as more pressing
  - From the middle of the fifth century, Athenian policy turned away from Persia and began to focus on conflict with Sparta and her allies
  - The Peace of Kallias likely represents an attempt by the Athenians to reach an understanding with the Persians in order to keep them out of the Aegean
- Colonies and Cleruchies
  - The Athenians used colonies to encourage the poor and the landless to leave Athens
  - Cleruchies functioned in the same way as Athenian colonies but allowed the settlers to remain Athenian citizens
    - This often relegated local populations to an inferior status
  - Even more irksome, according to Thucydides, was the system of tribute, by which the allies paid for their own servitude
  - Eventually the Athenians cancelled the entire system and replaced it with a flat 5% tax



## Summary 9: Inclusion and Exclusion: Life in Periklean Athens

- Drama
  - Greek drama probably grew out of the songs and dances accompanying rural festivals
  - Plots tended to be taken from well-known myth cycles, such as the Trojan War and the Seven Against Thebes Cycle
  - Robes and masks focused attention on the words and singing
  - Choruses often represented a kind of Everyman
  - Tragedies dealt with such deeply disturbing issues as incest and murder
    - Aristotle believed that watching such dramas provoked *katharsis*, or cleansing
  - Both tragedy and comedy were watched by the whole community
    - In effect they reinforced the democracy by providing a space for egalitarian performances
- The Akropolis
  - Under Perikles, the Akropolis was systematically and comprehensively rebuilt
    - It became the focal point for the expression of Athenian pride, both as a democratic state and an imperial power
  - The Parthenon replaced an older building on the south side of the Akropolis and was most likely paid for by the tribute received by the Athenians from the allies
  - The decoration of the Parthenon was revolutionary, depicting the Athenians performing the Panathenaic procession
  - The Propylaia and the Erechtheion also demonstrate the Periklean building program, designed to coordinate the many disparate cult sites of the Akropolis into one harmonious whole
    - Parts of the older buildings were still visible, offering tangible signs of the Akropolis's deep antiquity and sanctity
- Power and Exclusion
  - Athens was structured around twin poles of inclusion and exclusion
    - Foremost among those excluded from power and participation in civic life were Athenian women
  - Creation stories and early poetry reveal a deeply misogynistic vein in Athenian culture, also evident in sources of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, such as the works of Thucydides and Xenophon
  - Even a celebrated case, such as Lysias's speech on the Murder of Eratosthenes, reveals that a case of adultery was framed to an Athenian audience as principally a violation of the husband's rights
  - Sexual exploitation of women was common
  - Male sexuality also reflected uneven power dynamics
    - The Athenians practiced a form of pederasty that involved praising the beauty of boys and, if possible, seducing them
    - The difference between this and the exploitation of women was that boys were supposed to outgrow the role of *eromenos* on the way to becoming men
- Slavery
  - The most excluded members of Athenians society were slaves
  - From agricultural workers and miners to household slaves, the unfree provided the labor that made Greek culture possible
  - Slavery was omnipresent in Greek society and rarely questioned
  - A final excluded category are the metics, resident aliens who carried on much of Athens' commercial life and who rarely, if ever, were permitted citizenship



## Summary 10: Religion and Philosophy: Belief and Knowledge in the Classical Age

- Polis Religion
  - Religion and religious activities shaped the lives of the Greeks from birth to death
    - Coming of age for boys and girls was marked by religious ritual
  - The presence of sacrifice at every corner of social life shows that correct religious action played an enormous role in the lives of the Greeks
  - Recent discoveries of purification rites and sacred calendars remind us that the rhythm of daily life involved a continuous cycle of sacrificial and religious performances by the individual, by the local community, and by the state
- Conventional Belief
  - At the beginning of the 5th century BC, Athens in particular was a deeply conventional society in which the gods were seen as an active, integral part of daily life
  - Wearing very human faces, the gods of the Greeks were approachable and could be swayed, although the piety of the Greeks was deeply tinged by fear of the gods' power
  - To understand Greek religion it is valuable to keep in mind that it was not a religion of the book
    - No scripture dictated what a person must believe
    - Not only was the emphasis on action but it was also possible to recognize one's god in another's
    - Greek religion was not exclusive or proselytizing
- Splintering of Belief
  - The evolution of scientific medicine contributed a challenge to conventional thinking
    - Even as the cult of Asklepios was growing in popularity, so too the medical writing of Hippokrates and his students shows a new emphasis on empirical knowledge
  - The threat to conventional thinking also came from the Ionian philosophers of the 6th and 5th centuries BC, whose cosmological speculation had little place for the traditional gods
    - Instead they postulated a limitless universe, cosmic principles of elements in endless opposition, and a universe in constant flux
  - Some derided conventional views of the gods and castigated the venerable stories of Homer and Hesiod for making the gods as weak and venal as humans
  - The clash between new and old systems of thinking was commented on by contemporary commentators, such as Aristophanes
- Herodotos and Thucydides
  - The contrasting styles of Herodotos and Thucydides reveals the way that historiography mirrors the larger tensions and changes affecting the Greek world and Athens in particular
  - Though barely a generation apart, they employ very different methods
    - Herodotos relies on stories, dreams, oracles, and portents as if his writing were still influenced by Homer
      - He looks back to the world of the 6th century and earlier.
    - Thucydides writes in the manner of a pre-Socratic philosopher, banishing the gods from his account and instead trying to explain how warfare releases the worst human impulses
      - For him, the disease of a sick society can be analyzed in the same way as a Hippokratic doctor can read the symptoms of a sick body



## Summary 11: The Peloponnesian War

- Warfare and the Greeks
  - Warfare was a long-established staple of Greek life
    - Much early warfare consisted of border crossing and raiding
  - In the 6th century BC, hoplite warfare, conducted by heavily armed infantrymen in phalanx formation, emerged as the dominant mode of conflict
  - This development helped the emergence of democratic societies, in which men who fought side by side also served as fully enfranchised citizens
  - The establishment of democracy under Kleisthenes also saw the Athenian army adopt a high profile on the eve of the Persian Wars
  - Over the course of the 5th century BC the Athenians developed a formula for success: broad democracy, naval power, and imperial hegemony relied on and reinforced each other
- Causes of the Peloponnesian War
  - Sparta and Athens had followed divergent paths for some time
    - They spoke different dialects and exercised hegemony in different spheres
    - One was a conservative, inward-looking land power, the other a restless, outward-looking sea power
  - In the 430s a series of crises pushed the two states towards war
  - In 435 BC at Corcyra the Athenians intervened in a dispute between two Corinthian colonies: Epidamnos and Corcyra
    - In 433 BC at Potidaia the Athenians again provoked the Corinthians by laying siege to a Corinthian colony
  - The final straw was the Megarian Decree, an embargo on Megara imposed by the Athenians
  - All of these episodes represented an aggressive stance adopted by the Athenians, usually at the expense of Corinthian interests
- The Archidamian War
  - The first phase of the war lasted for a decade, during which the Spartans invaded each year
    - Following Perikles' policy, the Athenians relied on their walls for defense and brought supplies to the city by sea
  - Unexpectedly the city was devastated by a typhoid plague in the opening years of the war
    - Not only did this devastate Athens and demoralize the Athenians, it also took off Perikles
  - In the void left by the death of Perikles, Kleon emerged as the leading man
    - Violent and given to brinksmanship, he participated in two notable campaigns
    - He succeeded in capturing 420 Spartan hoplites on the island of Sphakteria but died in 422 BC at the battle of Amphipolis, along with the energetic Spartan general Brasidas
  - Both sides used these developments as an excuse to sign a peace treaty, the Peace of Nikias, in 421 BC
  - Peace did not last, but regional conflicts occupied the next campaigning seasons until the Athenians escalated the conflict
- The Sicilian Expedition
  - Between 415 and 413 BC the Athenians undertook a disastrous campaign in Sicily
    - Ostensibly undertaken to help the Athenian ally, Segesta, against the neighboring state of Selinous, in fact the campaign was an invasion designed to subdue Sicily and make it a part of Athens' empire
  - The campaign began in chaos, when statues of Hermes in Athens were desecrated on the eve of the fleet's departure
    - Shortly later, Alkibiades, a supporter of the expedition but implicated in the affair of the Hermes, jumped ship and defected to Sparta
  - For the next two seasons, the Athenians were led by Nikias, who proved to be a weak and vacillating commander
  - A great deal of the Athenian campaign consisted of building siege walls in an increasingly desperate attempt to capture Syracuse, the biggest and wealthiest Sicilian city
  - The campaign came to a climax in 413 BC during the Night Battle on the heights above Epipolai
    - Confused and demoralized, the Athenians were routed
  - In the weeks that followed the Athenian fleet was twice defeated
    - The remaining forces tried to flee by land but were cut off and captured
    - Nikias and Demosthenes were executed
- The Dekelean War
  - Despite the disaster in Sicily, the Athenians proved resilient
    - Even when an oligarchic coup saw the suspension of democracy in Athens, the fleet on Samos remained loyal to the spirit of the Athenian democracy
  - Following a defeat of the Spartans in 410 BC, democracy was restored in Athens and the city fought on
  - In the last phase of the war the Spartans built a permanent garrison on Athenian soil at Dekelea
  - The theater of war moved to the Hellespont, where Lysander attempted to choke off the Athenian grain supply
  - In 405 BC Lysander's fleet defeated the Athenians at the Battle of Aegospotamoi
  - The news reached Athens, and the Athenians faced the question of how they would be treated now that their empire was finished



## Summary 12: Panhellenism and the Rise of Philip

- Athens in Crisis
  - In the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, Lysander sailed into the port of Piraeus to take command of a defeated Athens
  - The Long Walls were dismantled
    - Most of the fleet was destroyed. Athens was reduced to dependence on Sparta
  - The Thirty, an oligarchy installed by Lysander, ruled oppressively and quickly became unpopular
  - Within a year a democratic resistance sprang up, eventually forcing the Thirty out and reinstating the democracy
- Sokrates
  - After the expulsion of the Thirty, the Athenians decided upon an amnesty
  - Nevertheless, the scars of the Thirty's reign ran deep and the period was one of anxiety
  - Although Sokrates had been regarded as something of a caricature earlier in his career, he was associated with the Thirty because he had been the teacher of Kritias, one of the leaders of the Thirty
  - His trial can be seen as a culmination of the religious anxieties and social tensions that had become more pronounced over the course of the Peloponnesian War
    - In other words, his trial served as the nearest thing to a political trial after the reign of the Thirty that could be conducted despite the amnesty that accompanied the restoration of democracy
- Spartan Hegemony
  - As victors, the Spartans enjoyed a new hegemony over many Greek states
  - Their rule was heavy-handed, involving the imposition of pro-Spartan oligarchies and garrisons
    - Their aggressions in Asia Minor prompted the Great King to subsidize a coalition against Sparta during the Corinthian War
    - This was followed by a Peace Treaty promulgated by the Great King to settle the war
  - The Athenian response was a cautious rebuilding of alliances, culminating in the Second Athenian Confederacy
  - Spartan authority remained heavy-handed in the Peloponnese, where they intervened in the internal affairs of neighboring states
  - The Sparta hegemony came to an end in 371 BC when they were comprehensively defeated by the Thebans at the Battle of Leuktra
  - The Theban hegemony lasted for less than ten years, but witnessed the founding of Messene in the land of the newly liberated Messenians, and Megalopolis in Arkadia
- Regionalism
  - Despite the continuing cycle of wars and successive hegemonies, the early 4th century BC is more than a repetition of earlier mistakes
  - A series of Common Peace Treaties, even if finally ineffectual, demonstrate that the Greek city-states were attempting to break the cycle of interstate violence
  - Leagues and federations, always a feature of Greek political and religious life, also became a notable feature of the political landscape
    - These regional groupings grew from a tendency to look for strength through aggregation
  - The final application of this principle was Panhellenism
    - Also a well-established feature of Greek life, in the fourth century bc Panhellenism took on fresh vitality as policy for unifying the Greeks
    - The 4th-century version of this, however, involved advocating a new Persian War
- Philip
  - Philip's career should be viewed against the backdrop of Macedonian history
    - Long marginalized, the Macedonians were looked down upon by the southern Greeks
  - His early career consisted on dynastic marriages and alliances designed to strengthen his control of Macedonia
  - His transformation of the Macedonian army saw the creation of a highly trained, professional, national army
  - He prosecuted plans for territorial expansion in every direction, coming into conflict with Athenian interests in the northern Aegean
  - By the mid-340s Philip had annexed territory as far south as Thermopylae
  - Once he had established the northern, western, and eastern borders of his expanded kingdom, he marched south
  - His victory at Chaironeia in 338 BC saw the end of the Classical order of independent Greek city-states and the beginning a new phase of Greek culture



## Summary 13: Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age

- Alexander's Early Reign
  - Alexander's reign began under a cloud
    - Philip had remarried in 337 BC, and a new heir would have been a threat to Alexander's position
    - When Philip was assassinated, Alexander moved quickly to annihilate any threats to his position
  - After quelling revolts in Greece, Alexander undertook the Asian campaign planned by his father
  - After an early victory at the Granikos, he began sweeping through Asia Minor
  - After a second victory, at Issos, he continued south through the Levant and all the way to Egypt
    - At Siwah he may have been greeted as the son of Zeus, a message he exploited propagandistically
- The Conquest of the East
  - At Gaugamela (in modern-day Iraq) Alexander conquered Darius III and in effect took his place
  - He continued marching further east in pursuit of the last Achaemenid king
    - After Darius was murdered by Bessos, Alexander pursued Bessos and executed him
  - Although the campaigns in the eastern satrapies are the stuff of romance and legend, Alexander's policy of founding cities points to a more serious purpose: annexing the nodes of an emerging trade route from China
  - The presence of Greeks in central Asia would not last long in terms of kingdoms and states, but the cultural fusion of Greek and Buddhist art from Gandhara points to the cross-fertilization of art and ideas
  - After turning south Alexander sought more provinces to conquer but after reaching northwestern India he was forced back after his men mutinied
  - He died in Babylon in 324 BC
- Ptolemaic Egypt
  - Alexander's generals carved a series of independent kingdoms from the carcass of Alexander's empire
    - The most successful of these was Ptolemaic Egypt
  - The Ptolemies inherited and refined a highly controlled state apparatus that oversaw a centralized economy
  - In Alexandria they sponsored a religious system that merged Greek and Egyptian cult practices, notably in the cult of Serapis
  - They presented themselves as pharaohs, adapting and adopting pharaonic practices, such as the continuing worship of the Apis bull
- Seleukids and Attalids
  - The Seleukids controlled much of the old Achaemenid realm, from Syria east to the edge of Iran
  - They too presented themselves as a renewal of an older dynasty, in this case the kings of Babylon
  - Seleukid history is often presented as 300 years of continuous decline, but they may have learned Alexander's lesson regarding control of the trade routes of central Asia
    - Controlling caravan routes and imposing taxes was a more profitable approach to empire than the control of vast swathes of territory
  - The Attalids controlled an even smaller domain, centered on Pergamon, but amassed great wealth
  - In common with the other dynasties, the Attalids craved legitimacy that they attempted to win by sumptuous acts of benefaction
    - Grain, money, and building were all given by the dynasties to key Greek cities and sanctuaries as ways of enhancing the dynasty's prestige
- Rome
  - Rome's involvement in the Greek world takes place after the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC
    - His failure, despite repeated successes, points to the astonishing reserves of manpower that Rome was capable of deploying in the field each year
  - Rome's move east was the result of many factors, not least of which was the impetus of each cohort of elite Romans to win glory in battle so as to amass wealth and political influence
  - Constantly responding to the threats of Hellenistic kings, successive waves of Roman armies fought further and further east after the defeat of Carthage in 202 BC
  - Rome's eastern entanglements had led to a change of policy by 146 BC
    - In the same year that Carthage was destroyed, so too was Corinth, while Macedonia was annexed as a Roman province
  - As Rome moved to absorb the Hellenistic east into the Roman imperium, more Greeks entered Rome, profoundly influencing the development of Roman culture
  - The melding of these cultures might have led to a true fusion, had Marc Antony and Cleopatra been victorious at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC
    - Instead Octavian was the victor and the entire Greek east was absorbed into the Roman empire
