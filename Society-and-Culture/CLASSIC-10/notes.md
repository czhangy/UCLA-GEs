## Lecture 1: Introduction

- Why Discover the Greeks? Three Proposals
  - In discovering the Greeks, the Greeks discover us
    - We are accustomed to seeing Greek influence all around us
      - Greek life
      - Mathematics
      - Our language
        - Syllabus comes from the Greek word sittuba ("label")
        - Idea comes from idein ("to see")
        - Biology comes from bios ("life") + logos ("study")
        - Pharmacy comes from pharmakon ("potions"/"drugs")
        - Democracy means "the people's power"
        - Zoe means "life"
        - Sophia means "wisdom"
        - etc.
      - Architecture
        - Washington D.C.
    - Discovery leads to self-reflection => the Greeks discovering us
    - We discover the Greeks asking questions, and in turn the Greeks discover us in the midst of our own questions
      - What is justice, and who determines it? (see *Iliad*)
      - What is the meaning of home? Is there such thing as a noble lie? (see *Odyssey*)
      - What is beauty, and is it merely a nicety or is it *essential* to life? (see Minoan and Mycenaean art)
      - What is the purpose of education (see Aristophances' *Clouds*)
      - What defines citizenship? Who gets to be a citizen (see Sophocles' *Antigone*)
      - What defines a nation or people? (see Herodotus' *Histories*)
      - Does religion make us sane or crazy? (see Euripides' *Bacchae*)
      - What is the good life? (see Plato's *Apology*, or really any of the course's texts)
    - A philosophy of buildings - Mausolus and Diogenes
  - No one has ever discovered the Greeks the way *you* will
    - Individual perspectives lead to individual conclusions
    - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
  - The Greeks are curious
    - For all the ways in which the Greeks are similar to us, there are many ways in which they are different
    - Polypragmon
      - Poly ("much"/"many") + pragma ("matter"/"thing"/"issue")
      - The Greeks are interested in many matters
      - Super busy
      - "Restless" (applied by comic playwrights to the Athenians)
      - "All up in your business" (applied to Socrates)
      - "Overly curious" (applied to Herodotus)
- Pragmatics
  - BCE and CE = BC and AD
  - Hellenic/Hellas = Greek/Greece
  - One challenge of evidence: often not contemporaneous (ex: Homer writing poems around 800 - 700 BCE, but referring to events that happened around 500 years prior)
    - Text originates from one time, but talk about another
  - Perspective of the evidence (elite, male, not only reflective of the world, but actively shaping it)
  - Spelling



## Lecture 2: The Big Bang: The Case of the Minoans

- The Greeks before "The Greeks"
  - Neolithic Greece (7000 - 3000 BCE)
  - Bronze Age (3000 - 1200 BCE)
    - Focus today on Minoans
    - Wednesday on Mycenaeans
- A fundamental fact: there is much that we don't know
- Greece "before the Greeks"
  - The nature of the evidence: mostly non-textual
  - How might we "read" that evidence?
  - When we read Homer this week and next, how should we relate Homeric poetry to the societies of Bronze Age Greece?

- Big Questions in Background
  - What are the roles of beauty (decorative objects, paintings, etc.) in Bronze Age (i.e. Minoan and Mycenaean) culture?
    - What did they think about them?
    - Are we projecting what we think about them?
  - How might we speculate about the societal structure of Bronze Age societies? Consider ideas of hierarchy, redistributive economy, and possibly gender roles
  - What functions does religion seem to have?
    - What does it imply about how groups of people thought about their place in the world?
- Neolithic Greece (c. 7000 - 3000 BCE)
  - Stone tools, pre-smelting
  - We start to see oats, wild barley, etc. in the agricultural record
  - Fish bones in caves tells us people were eating fish => shows degree of sophistication
  - Towards the latter half of the era:
    - Mud huts
    - Domestication of crops
    - Introduction of pottery => movement beyond stone tools to the manipulation of earth into vessels used for various purposes
      - Terracotta figurine of woman => purpose unknown
      - Polychrome (multi-colored) vase => shows deliberate use of time to decorate vessel, object no longer strictly utilitarian
  - Dimini (c. 4800 - 4500 BCE)
    - What is the purpose of the set of concentric walls that surround the site?
      - Were they for defensive purposes?
      - Were they used for retaining the earth?
        - Were they both?
    - The presence of a **megaron** (a large central building) that isn't easily accessible
      - To what extent does this central space indicate the presence of a central authority of some kind?
      - View the way architecture can imply social organization
- The Bronze Age (c. 3000 - 1200 BCE)
  - Widespread adoption of bronze metallurgy (alloy of copper and tin, and sometimes other metals)
    - Something more complex than the tools from the Neolithic Age, signifies technological advancement
  - Circulation of goods and people throughout the Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean
    - Port-to-port trading (cabotage)
    - Places have become more settled
    - Things end up in a site far away from where they were produced (movement of people)
      - Things acquire value by being far away from their source
  - Cycladic Figurine from Cycladic Islands (2600 - 2400 BCE)
    - Made of marble
    - Usually found in burial sites
      - Hundreds of thousands of occurrances
    - Hard to interpret
      - Idol? Representation of someone offering themselves to the gods? Human? Deity? Meant to show beauty?
- The "Minoans"
  -  Minoan Culture (1900 - 1450 BCE)
    - One of 2 major Bronze Age cultures of Ancient Greece (the other being the Mycenaeans)
    - Primary site of inhabitation: the island of Crete
      - Settlements at Knossos and Thera
      - Away from the central power of Greece on the mainland
  - Aesthetics
    - Why did they make the objects they made?
  - Mystery
    - Things we can't know from inference
  - Myth
    - The Minotaur and the Labyrinth
    - King Minos is brought up by Thucydides in antiquity (5th century BCE)
      - In reference to his vast naval power (thalassocracy)
  - Knossos
    - Much of what we know about Knossos is shaped by Sir Arthur Evans
      - Archaeologist determined to prove the existence of King Minos and the Minotaur
      - Includes name of the Minoans themselves
      - Not all of this information is historically accurate
    - The Labyrinth is possibly the palace at Knossos
      - Extremely complex floor layout => winding maze
      - Exaggeration of the megarons from Neolithic Greece
      - Architecture suggestive of centralized power
    - The Palace at Knossos
      - May not be a home as we understand it
      - Other sites lead us to believe palaces were used as religious/economic centers
    - Bull-Leaping
      - Ritual holds a high significance in Minoan culture
      - Bull-leaping signet ring is speculated to show a religious story of the movement of the stars
      - Bull's Head Rhyton
        - Used as a libations rhyton, then destroyed
      - Leads to question of what did the Minoans think of what it meant to live a good life?
  - Linear A
    - System of writing used by Minoans
    - Cannot be translated
      - What has been translated is not particularly interesting - mostly logs
  - Linear B
    - Has been translated, complex relation to Linear A
  - Redistributive Economy
    - Surplus of staple goods used to support non-essential workers and farmers in the event food was scarce
      - A balancing act
      - People in charge of maintaining a surplus and people in charge of creating the surplus
      - Attempt at societal organization
    - Pithoi - large storage vessels
  - Less Elite Sites
    - Building I-O-N at Vronda
      - Humble houses
      - Signs of cookware, animal slaughter, etc.
      - Perhaps more representative of common folk
      - Expansion indicative of multiple generations
  - Akrotiri, Thera
    - Cosmopolitan harbor city filled with frescoes
      - Were these religious? Celebration of wealth? Celebration of accomplishment?
      - Saffron Gatherer
      - Fisherman Fresco
      - Flotilla Fresco
      - West House Fresco
        - Earliest representation of the story of Troy?
    - Destroyed by eruption of a volcano
- The Big Bang: What Destroyed Minoan Culture?
  - Myth helpful? Destruction of Atlantis
  - The problems of 1628 BCE and 1450 BCE
    - Marine style pottery post-dates volcanic eruption at Akrotiri
    - Minoans likely weren't destroyed immediately by the volcano at Akrotiri
  - Safest conclusion: destruction of Thera disrupted trade networks and likely hurt agriculture elsewhere, but other Minoan sites persist until 1450 BCE
- Tentative Conclusions about Minoans
  - Architecture implies some kind of centralized authority and possibly a redistributive economy
    - Are the heroes of the *Iliad* representative of authority figures?
  - Frescoes especially suggest an attention to aesthetics (but to what end?)
    - Man vs. Monkey is an example of a reminder that we can mistakenly project meaning onto the Minoans
  - Religious objects and space indicate awareness of the fragility of life?
    - Destruction of Thera in 1628 and other sites around 1450 BCE
    - Things wouldn't always endure



## Lecture 3: The Mycenaeans

- Two Bronze Age societies
  - The Minoans (1700 - 1450 BCE)
    - Knossos
    - Akrotiri on Thera
  - The Mycenaeans (1500-1100 BCE)
    - Mycenae
    - Troy
    - Knossos
- The Mycenaeans: Three Things to Explore
  - Conspicuous power (esp. expressed architecturally and in material remains)
  - Bellicosity (in material remains and in likely takeover of Minoan sites)
  - Homeric connections
- Heinrich Schliemann (1822 - 1890)
  - Schliemann is responsible for much of what we know about the Mycenaeans
  - Determined to prove Homer, Agamemnon, etc. were real
  - Can be credited with discovering what we now believe is Troy and the unearthing of Mycenae
    - Was also a falsifier/exaggerator/liar, so take his discoveries with a grain of salt
- The Fortress Site of Mycenae
  - Highly indicative of wealth, conveying a sense of power and formidability
    - Cyclopean walls
    - Heroic burials
    - Massive tombs
  - City of Agamemnon
  - Lion's Gate, Grave Circles, Treasury of Atreus, etc.
  - Goods from Grave Circle A
    - Lion Fight Dagger, Gold Death Mask
    - Gold shows high reverence for those they buried
    - Absence of mineral-rich terrain nearby indicates a large web of connections with other civilizations
- What about ordinary lives?
  - Doeroi/doerai - slaves
    - Perfume manufacturing workers
    - Textile workers
  - Bronzesmiths, bow-makers, chariot-builders, shepherds
    - Mentioned in tablets
  - People who carded wool and weaved flax for ships' sails
  - People who grew and harvested beets, sesame, fennel, mint, celery, etc.
  - Geronsia (council) and damos (group of landholders)
    - Gerousia (council of elders in Sparta)
    - "Demos" (people)
- Mycenaean Takeover of Knossos (c. 1450 BCE)
  - The "smoking gun" - the replacement of Linear A (Cretan) by Linear B (early Greek) at Minoan sites
    - Results in the conclusion that the Mycenaeans took over the Minoan sites
  - Story of King Minos and the Minotaur and Theseus slaying the Minotaur may act as a myth in reference to the Mycenaean takeover of the Minoans
    - Perversion of the Minoans' reverence for bulls
- Linear B
  - Discovered to be inflective
  - Some translations resemble Greek
  - Lack of literature, literature remained oral
    - Written information were records, tax info, etc.
  - Linear A and Linear B are both syllabaries
    - Linear A
      - Minoans
      - Untranslated
    - Linear B
      - Mycenaeans
      - Translated
      - Form of Greek
      - Presence at Minoan sites indicates Mycenaean takeover at those site
- The "Evidence" from Homer
  - Reading the *Iliad*
    - Focus on the main issues in each book: conflict and consequences (Book 1); the death of Patroclus and the description of Achilles' shield (Book 18); and the destruction of Troy and the human consequences esp. Andromache's lament (Book 22)
    - Pay attention to its aesthetics (similes, descriptive epithets for characters): why are these there and how do they generate sympathy and enhance the reading experience?
    - What does it mean that a culture's first great work of literature focuses on the pain, rage, pathos, of an individual?



## Lecture 4: Homer + the Mycenaeans: Facts and Fictions 

- Pylos and Troy
  - The "Palace at Pylos"
    - Opulent
    - Tons of Linear B palace providing administrative information
    - The Palace of Nestor
    - Built atop an acropolis
      - Acropolis - high point of a city
- Minoans and Mycenaeans
  - After the Mycenaean takeover, we see the circulation of Minoan goods back to the Mycenaean mainland
    - Is this just pure conquest or is there an admiration for the conquered society?
- Homer
  - A lot of the sense of recalling something grander
    - "The past is better"
  - Conclusions about Homeric Pylos
    - There are some apparent correspondences between Homer's descriptions of such things as "Nestor's Palace" and the court-complex at Pylos
      - Earth-shaker
      - Capacity for long-term storage
      - Cups made of gold
      - Many benches
    - Terminology for palace rule is inconsistent or vague in Homer (who's in charge, the wanax or the basileus?)
- Was the Trojan War real?
  - In antiquity, Greeks were thinking about the history of the Trojan War
    - Whether or not it happened seems to have mattered to their identity
    - Thucydides relates its existence to Greek Unity
  - Questioning the Myth
    - Agamemnon cited as having gained leadership in the war since he was the preeminently powerful man in Greece at the time (wealth of Mycenae)
      - Relied on fear to assemble his expedition, not goodwill
    - Hero Shrine of Menelaus and Helen
      - Idea in the *Iliad* that Helen was hated by the Greeks
      - A shrine in Lakonia with evidence that Helen was continually worshipped
        - Archaeological evidence contradicts myth
    - There is a layer of Troy that seems to have been destroyed by siege
      - Fits the right timeline
      - The preceding layer of Troy had evidence of Mycenaean pottery
  - Hittite Correspondence (c. 1300 - 1200 BCE)
    - Diplomatic letters mention "Wilusa" (Ilion == Troy?)
    - Piyamaradu ~ Priam?
    - Alaksandu ~ Alexandros == Paris?
- Homeric Version of Events
  - Not written down until after 750 BCE
  - Oral formulaic poetry (to be explained Monday)
  - Different versions of the poems based on difference performances
  - Potential differences between the "poet's time" (which change over centuries) and the "poem's time"
  - Complicated by the inherent nostalgia of the poems
  - Homer as a hybrid
    - Ex: chariots driven into battle, followed by fighting hand-to-hand => Bronze Age vs. Iron Age tech
- Homeric Facts and Fictions about the Bronze Age
  - Yes, Homeric poems make reference to elements of the Bronze Age world
  - But Homer's poems represent a tradition that accrued over many decades and centuries
    - They thus also exhibit elements from a later age, such as:
      - Iron weapons
      - Funeral pyres
      - Fighting as a mobile infantry
    - Show aspects of Homer's time, the past, and the even later past
- The End of the Mycenaean World (c. 1200 - 1100 BCE)
  - Why?
  - Dispersal of peoples, palaces occupied by squatters and shepherds, etc.
  - Slave revolt? Climate changes? Siege?
  - Best answer: the Sea People
    - People that exploited the weakness of various Mycenaean sites?
      - Wall-less Pylos
    - Their presence attests to the massive upheavals in the Mediterranean
  - Nostalgia of Homer's poems and tendency to magnify the past come from the fact that they were written in a downturn of Greece



## Lecture 5: Homer as the Internet

- Homer
  - Even in antiquity, Homer's literature was highly valued
  - There is an air of mystery surrounding Homer
  - Much like the Internet today, Homer was the prevalent resource for learning about living, virtue, etc. in antiquity
    - Sense of Homer having total knowledge
    - Links different people across time and space, giving them a collective idea of their past
    - Was "editable" - the storyteller could modify his stories to adjust for the locale/audience
  - An oral phenomenon originally
  - Some facts?
    - The epic poems called the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* are long narrative poems, sung in verse or chanted, often before an audience
    - Oral poems: for performance, for recitation, more than reading
    - Composition of the poems as we have them now is usually dated to the mid to late 8th century or early 7th century
      - About 400 years of recitation before the stories were written down
    - Homer was likely the poet/the name of the editor who recorded the oral tradition and crafted two poems out of that tradition
      - Not mutually exclusive
      - Some claim Homer is the name of the oral tradition as a whole
- Oral Composition and Authorship
  - Milman Parry
    - Made comprehensive notes on the building blocks of oral composition
      - These building blocks are vehicles of memory
      - Related these observations to Homeric tradition
    - Substitution of descriptions were made in stories, keeping the main story the same
  - Albert Lord
- Homeric "Coding"
  - Poetic meter: dactylic hexameter as "code"
    - Long short short - `^ ^` (dactyl)
    - Long long - `-` (spondee)
    - Hard to get to work in English
    - Based on the quantity of the vowel
  - Epithets as Coding/Building Blocks
    - "Resourceful Odysseus"
    - "Helen of the lovely hair"
    - What is the purpose of these formulae?
      - Gives the orator the ability to stitch things together in meter
- Glances into the Power of Homer
  - Achilles' Great Speech
    - Philosophizes about war, those who have nothing vs. those who have much
    - Compares himself to a mother bird, creating contrast between the act of war and the beauty of nature
    - The paradox of the heroic life
      - Desire for the hero to return home involves failing to die in battle and memorializing your name
  - The Gods
  - The Human Cost
    - Andromache's Lament
- *Odyssey*
  - Tells the story of Odysseus' ten-year homecoming after ten years of war
  - Focus on the household with special attention to his son and wife
  - Also on Odysseus' suffering adventures
  - Odysseus' Mortal Choice
    - A moment where he has to choose what kind of life he wants
      - Calypso's island
    - Offered the chance to become immortal, but he chooses to return home
  - Penelope's Subjectivity
    - A secret shared between Odysseus and Penelope
    - Penelope's perspective
- Homer's Hold on Us
  - Emotional vividness
  - Grandeur in language ("wine-blue water", "teeth's barrier") and plotting (think of the many books of delay in Odysseus' arrival)
  - Also the tiny details: "her heart pondering much," or Andromache's thoughts on her orphaned son
  - Sheer vitality, across many centuries



## Lecture 6: The Iron Age

- Chronology
  - Bronze Age (Minoans and Mycenaeans) = 2000 - 1100 BCE
  - Iron Age = 1100 - 700 BCE
  - Iron Age, sometimes called the Dark Age or Geometric Period
- Lefkandi
  - Based in a large settlement from about 950 BCE
    - People that lived here, and their houses, were buried under this structure
    - Are the burials the burial sites of some heroic/ruler figure? 
  - Indications of trade with other locations
    - Bronze amphora
  - Indications of wealth
    - Large amounts of gold, manufactured centuries before the burial
    - Indicates high social status of the buried
  - Contrary to the fall of palatial structures, other settlements like Lefkandi continued to operate
- Revising the Dark Ages
  - Centaur figurine broken into 2 pieces and thrown into 2 graves
    - Beyond utilitarian
    - Suggested to be representative of Chiron
  - Pithos depicting the Trojan Horse
    - Evidence of continuity over the centuries, despite the decline of other aspects of civilization
  - Shows that cultural phenomena did persist => is the Dark Age really dark?
- Decline? It Depends on Where You Dig
  - Inhabitants of east-central Greece didn't experience as much decline as those further south
  - Calls into question why scholars were so quick to dub this period as a period of decline
- Evidence of Continuity
  - Hero cults (cultural memory)
    - People from the distant Bronze Age era continued to be honored by people during the Iron Age
  - Homeric poems
    - Being recited at festivals, ceremonies, get-togethers, etc.
  - Ancient tombs preserved
    - Tholos tomb, Attica, c. 1400 BCE
    - Dromos shows pottery from Iron Age to Classical Period
  - "Nestor's Cup" c. 725 BCE
    - Found in Bay of Naples (far west side of the Italian Peninsula)
      - Informative of Greek movement at this time
    - Some of the earliest evidence of a new Greek alphabet, after the disappearance of Linear B
- Phoenician Signary and Greek Alphabet
  - Greeks took over the Phoenician system and applied it to Greek sounds
    - Possibly for trade standardization purposes?
  - da, de, di, do, du
    - In Linear B, each of the above would have been a different symbol
    - In Phoenician one symbol or letter stood for all
    - Greek letter delta represents only the sound that those syllables have in common
    - Greek adds written vowels
- Other Evidence against the Dark Age?
  - Dipylon Amphora (765 - 730 BCE Athens)
    - More evidence of cultural productivity during the Dark Age
    - Mass produced in a workshop
    - Mark a grave and display burial activity
- The oikos
  - Roughly means household
  - A patrilineal family unit, including servants, retainers, slaves, etc.
  - Represented in the *Odyssey*
  - Think of Lefkandi as being the home of a particular oikos
  - The lowly thete
    - A person unattached to an oikos and/or owning no land
    - Have no personal security
    - Immigrants, refugees, escaped slaves, etc.
    - Mentioned in Achilles' dialogue in the *Odyssey*
- Early Law from Dreros, Crete
  - Regardless of the lack of literature present from the period, it's significant that law has been written
  - Much of early Greek law is procedural, rather than theoretical
  - The written nature of the law curbs arbitrariness for the people in antiquity
- Units of Identity in Migration from Metropolis
  - Ethne - people who asserted a common ethnic identity
  - Koinon - political federations
  - Oikoi - households, including slaves
  - Kleros - a plot of land
    - Give people an incentive to get them to relocate
  - Agora - marketplace
  - Polis - city-state or city
  - Idea that the Greeks mythologize their encounters with others, vilifying the "other" and highlighting their conquests
    - Evident in their artwork
-  Institution of the Olympics
  - Supposedly started by Heracles
  - Actual occurrence that creates Greek unity
  - Promotion of Greekness/Panhellism
  - Acts as a religious festival - it was a sacred event
  - Participation in the Olympics is how you won glory and undying fame
  - Pindar (6th - 5th century BCE)
    - Odes to the glorious athletes
    - Writes on the vulnerability of success and how victory is fleeting



## Lecture 7: The (Strange?) Case of Sparta

- Archaic Age or Period: Roughly 750/700 - 480 BCE
  - Bronze Age => Iron Age => Archaic Age => Classical Age
  - A period of tension (stasis) internally within the society
    - Two axes:
      - Vertical between the elite and those with less power
      - Horizontal between aristocratic families
  - How does Sparta choose to iron out these tensions in the way their constitution is composed?
- Sparta, in Lakonia, on the Peloponnesus
  - Also think about the other dependent territories neighboring Sparta
  - Geographically isolated
    - How did this alter Sparta's course compared to a city like Athens?
  - Laconic - short of speech
    - In antiquity, Spartans were not typically thought of as masterful orators
  - Place of seemingly restrained wealth and aesthetic
- "The Spartan Mirage": Seeing what one wants to see
  - Sources for Sparta include:
    - Herodotus (c. 430 BCE)
    - Thucydides (end of the 400s BCE)
    - Xenophon (b. Athens c. 430 BCE)
      - The Spartan Constitution
    - Plutarch (46 - 126 CE)
      - Biographer and ethical philosopher, not historian
      - Lives include that of Lykourgos
  - Contemporary references to Sparta as a way to use their legacy for their purposes
  - The mirage is an old fashioned phenomenon
    - Lykourgos leaving the example of Sparta as a city as his legacy
    - How much is accurate and how much is legend?
    - Poetry enforcing their military ideology
- Spartan Domination
  - Helots - serfs or slaves of the Spartan state, including the subjugated peoples of Messenia
    - Primarily agricultural slaves
    - Forced to wear clothes to identify their class
    - Forced to humiliate themselves
    - Establishes a huge chasm of inequality between them and the elite Spartan males
    - Outnumbered Spartans 7:1
    - Thought to not be under direct, personal control, just under their range of dominion
  - Helot existence likely shaped Spartan life
    - Threat of rebellion
    - Many attempts by the helots to force their way out of the Spartan subjugation
  - Perioeci (people who lived around Sparta) served in the Spartan army
- What (Else) Makes Sparta Unique
  - Treatment of children and male youths ("Ephebes")
    - Children taken from their families and grow up with other young boys
    - System of military training called agoge
  - Syssitia (mess-hall groups; dining groups)
    - Imposed to promote solidarity/military brotherhood
  - War itself brought a respite to training for war
- Spartiate Homoioi ("equals") + Others
  - Brotherly training + militaristic life meant to promote equality between the elite
    - Allowed to abuse and demean other homoioi if you felt it helped keep them in line
    - Women essential in this process
  - Hypomeiones (inferiors)
    - Failed to meet the military ideal, physically weak, etc.
  - Krypteia - a spy system by which Spartans attempted to control helots by having young Spartan men spying on helots, who could murder them if caught
- Xenelasia
  - Annual expulsion of foreigners
  - Shows Spartan distrust of outside influence
- Spartan Government and Eunomia
  - Spartan government: misotyrannos?
    - Tyrant-hating
    - Mixed-constitution => elements of oligarchy, democracy
    - Dual kingship (basileis)
      - One is a check on the other
      - Insurance policy for wartime
      - Kings also chief priests, an important role for a society valuing public sacrifice
    - Gerousia - council of elders
      - 28 men over the age of 60 who serve the rest of their lives
      - Kings were a part of the Gerousia
      - Wealthy men who were elected
      - Voted by voice
      - Court for high crime
    - Ephors - judicial overseers/magistrates; inspectors of youth
      - 5 of these elected annually
      - Over the age of 30
      - King's supervisors
      - Could impeach and dethrone kings if reason called for it
      - Self-audited by successive ephors
    - Assembly - ekklesia
      - All male citizens over the age of 30
      - ~95% of people in Sparta were not citizens (helots, perioeci, women, etc.)
- Women in Sparta
  - Women were often part of the exercise routine of Spartans 
  - Notorious for boldness and outspokenness
    - Not quite correct to see them as entirely liberate
  - Often separated from their husbands => allowed polyandry
    - Resolves potential dispute of inheritance, shrinking the lines of descent
  - No obligation to engage in moneymaking/domestic work
  - Aristotle complains 40% of land was controlled by women => had property rights
  - Plutarch's *Sayings in Spartan Women*
    - Women fully in line with Spartan military ethos
    - Criticism/praise of the homoioi
  - Alkman (late 7th, early 6th century BCE)
    - Lyric poet
    - Partheneion - "maiden-song"
    - Wrote poetry performed publicly, praising women
- Spartan Culture
  - Vix Krater found in Celtic France => reinforces the sense of Spartan intimidation/strength
  - Lot of negative/repressive/harsh aspects, in contrast with beauty
  - Always existing as a foil to Athens

## Discussion 1: Homer and Stesichorus

- Focus on the oral nature of the works in this course
- Discussion on the imagery of the poppy
  - Beauty in the face of death
  - Shows the huge range of spheres used by Homer
    - Introduction of the epic simile as a vehicle for discussion of the rest of the world outside of war
    - "The greatest works in literature are those in which nothing is not talked about in some way"
  - Grace, speed, economy of narrative
  - Blurring of the lines between good and evil
    - Completely different sense of morality
    - No obvious villain in the Iliad
    - An evocation of sympathy for both sides
- Chorus/choral poetry => epic
  - Epic - an orally performed genre of poetry in which heroic subjects are treated 
- Die and destroy are related in the language of the Ancient Greeks



## Discussion 2: The Mycenaeans and the *Iliad*

- The Mycenaeans
  - The assumptions of the archaeologists in reconstructing the art of the Mycenaeans
  - The analysis of the Linear B tablets requires extrapolating data about a large period of time from simple snapshots of what are essentially reciepts
- The *Iliad*
  - General theme of will of the gods vs. the will of man
  - When reading Homer, people tend to visualize characters as embodiments of different vices
  - Ecphrasis - the detailed description of some object in poetry
    - The language describing some piece of art becomes the piece of art
  - Concern throughout Greek history about convincing others in argumentative ways
    - Persuasion seems to fall flat in the *Iliad*
  - Aristos - the best, rule of the best, who's the best



## Discussion 3: The *Odyssey*

- Ogygia
  - locus amoenus - "the lovely place"
  - A nonsensical landscape, completely mystical
    - Makes its appeal and pleasure felt
  - Doesn't quite capture Odysseus
    - Holds on to home, familiarity, love, and Penelope
    - nostos - the return journey
- How do the value systems differ between the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*?



## Discussion 4:

- 



## Reading 1: Why Study the Greeks?

- Cultures in Dialogue
  - Modern thinking pulls democracy, medicine, architecture, astronomy, ethics, poetry, dance, mathematics, etc. from the Greeks
    - Atomic theory of Demokritos and Leukippos
    - Mathematical theorems of Euclid
    - Democracy - **demos** (people) + **kratos** (rule)
    - Concepts of truth and beauty
- Truth and Beauty
  - Beauty in poetry and sculpting
    - Homer's Iliad
    - Sculpting of limestone and marble as learned from the Egyptians
      - Took the Egyptians' work and revolutionized it with a form of naturalism
  - Plato's *Symposium* describes how "the seeker of truth will hunt for the beauty to be found in all things"
    - The seeker will find beauty in bodies and also in laws and civil institutions
  - View culture in contrast to modern day pop culture
    - Shows us a battle between thoughtful, ethical engagement with the world and bland superficiality
      - Significance vs. triviality
    - Knowing the Greeks better = knowing ourselves better
  - **kore** - statue of a young woman
  - Ancient works compel us to ask questions of a strange, yet recognizable society
  - Greeks stand at the head of Western culture
    - Greeks are a model of perfection
    - We have a real and tangible connection to them, but it must be scrutinized
- Democracy, Ancient and Modern
  - In our world, democracy takes two forms: parliamentary and presidential
    - Franchise extends to both men and women 18+, citizens elect governments to represent them, and governments are answerable to the people
  - Greek democracy has its differences
    - No women
    - Foreigners given little chance to participate
    - Structure founded on slaves giving citizens the opportunity to participate
    - Male citizens voted in the **Ekklesia**, an Athenian assembly that voted on matters such as public contracts, taxes, and declarations of war
      - Direct democracy
      - Members of the **Boule** were elected representatives of their tribe at random, served for 1 year, and then couldn't serve again for 10
    - Athenians were the government
      - Government was not separate from the people
    - Denounced in that it favored the poor, not the higher class members of Greek society
  - Free societies are capable of the highest aspirations, but must confront their own shortcomings
    - Experience the tension between altruistic aspirations and conspicuous failures
    - Failure leads to the unveiling of social tension
      - The plague in Ancient Greece vs. Hurricane Katrina today
- Greek Architecture and Philosophy
  - Hard to imagine the Western world finding its expressions for power and national identity without the model of the Greeks
  - Orders of Greek architecture: Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian
  - Architectural vocabulary is derived from the styles and forms of the Greeks
  - Emphasizes the motifs of similarity and difference in our relationship with the Greeks
  - Western philosophy builds off of the work of the Greeks
    - Works are however outdated
      - Plato and Aristotle's work on slavery
      - Modern societies have to work with the elitist thinking of the Greeks when it comes to topics such as slavery and women's rights
- East versus West?
  - The championing of the Greeks results in the mindset that Western civilization is superior
    - The post-WWI state of the Middle East acts as a footnote in Western history, but is vastly significant to those in the Middle East (9/11)
  - We take on an obligation to understand the origin of our own societies before we continue to repeat mistakes of the past
    - Greeks vs. Persia
  - The defeat of Leonidas at Thermopylae is an example of the victors romanticizing the war, altering historical perspective
  - We have inherited the Western stereotype of "the Eastern other" from the Greeks
- Paideia
  - All study of history feeds historical consciousness and helps us better understand our societies
    - The Greeks are a direct view into our past, unlike China or the Maya
  - We return to the Greeks' ideals of exploring ethics honestly, debating policy vigorously, valuing beauty deeply, and acting in a spirit of generosity and civility
    - This is the Greek paideia
  - The Greeks act as a model for who we aim to be and a reminder that flawed societies can still distinguish themselves



## Reading 2: Early Greece and the Minoans: The Labyrinth and the Minotaur

- Greece in the Neolithic: The Origins of Complex Societies
  - Early hominins reached Crete by sea no later than 130,000 years ago
  - Beginning from the Franchthi Cave, evidence of human occupation spreads outwards to the nearby coastal waters
    - Same thing occurs at the Alepotrypa Cave and Dikili Tash
  - Connectedness and the Beginnings of Pottery
    - These societies were able to trade over long distances
    - Sesklo marks the introduction of pottery to the Greek world
    - Communities of Sesklo and Dimini were agro-pastoral
      - People lived by farming and herding, with some parts of their diet supplemented by hunting and gathering
      - Expanding complexity when compared with earlier communities at Franchthi and Deros
      - Existence of walls and a central building called a **megaron** reveal central planning
        - Possible emergence of class distinctions that would later characterize Minoan society
- The Third Millenium: The Bronze Age
  - Growing complexity continues with the adoption of bronze in the 3rd millennium BC + the connectivity of the Aegean world
  - Evidence from the Tsepi cemetery shows the refining process of cupellation and the smelting of lead and silver
  - Impressive construction at Lerna show evidence of labor and centralized authority
    - Existence of a **tumulus** (earthen mound) may be intended to commemorate a powerful chief
  - Evidence of a centrally organized community comes from excavations at Phylokopi, Poliochni, Myrina, Koukonisi, Skarkos
    - Complex buildings and drainage systems in Skarkos + Myrina
  - Keros-Syros culture
    - Used to describe a number of sites in the Cyclades that share the same type of pottery and building design
    - The homogeneity wasn't achieved by peace, possible assertion of power on smaller settlements by larger ones
  - Cycladic figurines
    - Can be dated, function is difficult to identify
    - Most are schematic representations of the female body
    - Dolls? Suggesting of a cult of female fertility? Representative of deities or spirits? Used as part of a ceremony?
  - As the cities grew in size, they grew more stratified
    - The degree of connectivity between them shows a unique connectedness of these cities due to the proximity to water
      - This water encouraged communication of goods/people/ideas
- Minoan Crete
  - Crete's discovery demonstrates there was material that could be connected with the world of Homeric poems
    - Discovered by Heinrich Schliemann
    - Home of the legendary King Minos and the Minotaur
    - Discovery of a civilization that only existed in myth until then
  - Cretan Bronze Age
    - The broadest categories of Minoan chronology concern the development, acme, destruction, and rebuilding of its palaces
      - Similarity between Syrian and Cretan palace design is evidence of Cretan culture participatin gin a wider world of complex, hierarchically organized states
      - The complex displays a theocratic character, leading scholars to suggest that the palaces were ceremonial and ritual centers
      - Similar ground plan of Knossos to other major sites suggest a homogeneous Cretan culture
      - Rooms give impression of a sophisticated and refined elite living in comfort
  - Bull-leaping
    - Performance that acted as a re-enactment of an astronomical story explaining the movement of the stars
    - Bull cult has immense importance
    - Also present in Avaris in Egypt, showing that Cretans participated in a much broader range of cultural relations beyond the Greek mainland/nearby islands
      - In exchange for bringing gifts to the Egyptian pharaoh, it's possible Egyptian-built fleets were used to help Cretans project their power beyond their homeland
    - Bulls were likely sacrificed and venerated
    - Rituals in combination with various features of Cretan palaces are evidence that Minoan society took on an elaborate hieratic character
  - Minoan Religion
    - Despite connections with other areas, Crete was different from the rest of the eastern Mediterranean
      - Do not appear to have been temples to gods
      - Gold rings depicting figures hovering in the air may be suggestive of a moment of epiphany/arrival of divine spirit
      - Speculation that Minoan religion involves rites and practices that result in altered consciousness/spiritual possession
        - Minoan iconography is also suggestive of this - crown of opiates
    - The reality is, we know very little about the beliefs and practices of these people
    - Feasting
      - Significant as a crucial social institution
      - The community is most vividly on display
      - Opportunity for elites to advertise their power
      - Encourages social bonding and can be identified by distinctive ceramic assemblages
      - Carried out as part of funerary rites and religious festivals
      - Gives expression to a rich and complicated social structure
  - Minoan Literature
    - Minoans didn't record liturgical texts, legal documents, or historical chronicles in any semi-permanent forms
    - Did develop a writing system known as Linear A
      - Syllabic and ideographic system employed by scribes
      - Little survives, cannot be translated effectively
      - Second writing system called Linear B
        - Has been successfully translated
        - Disappointing from the view of poetry and literature
        - Useful in understanding the palatial economy
          - The palace was a center of a redistributive economy
    - Minoan Economy
      - Redistributive economy - a complex economic system based on the regular accumulation of surpluses of staple goods
        - Surplus used to support specialized craftsmen and to support farmers in times of crop failure and food shortage
        - Depends on a delicate balance of relations between palace elites and laborers
      - Staple items - oil, grain, wine, etc.
      - Luxury items - precious metals and perfume
      - Manufactured items show that palaces were centers of production and manufacturing
        - Centers of both religion and the economic system
      - Relies on control of the population by the palace
        - Not necessarily exploitative, cooperation leads to success for both sides
        - Receiving from the palace's surplus allows for survival in times of need
        - Giving labor and produce to the palace may have served as a form of devotion to the gods due to the perception of the palace as "home of a god-king"
- Beyond the Palaces
  - No suggestion that palaces controlled all local religious practices
    - Mountain peaks and caves show evidence of sacrifices and dedications pre-dating palaces
  - Settlements popped up without an identifiable center, showing evidence of growth over time, consistent with occupation over multiple generations
    - Remind us that there is a great deal to be learned about the ordinary people
  - Palaces reproduced at a smaller scale also appeared around the countryside, unlikely to be serving directly under the influence of a real palace
  - Various settlements show evidence of serious maritime trade throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean
    - Shipwrecks reveal a great deal about trade and conditions at the time
    - Cargo reveals goods from ports all around the Mediterranean
    - Cabotage relies on the principle that goods increase in value as they become more scarce and exotic
      - Goods may be easy to transport by sea, but will rise in value in locations in which there is no local source of production
- Thera: A Minoan Settlement
  - Akrotiri (known as Thera in antiquity) was a flourishing settlement that may have been founded as a Minoan colony
    - Overlooked the caldera of an active volcano
    - The volcano destroyed the town when it erupted
    - Described as a cosmopolitan merchant harbor
  - Frescoes explore various common motifs
    - Scholars note a possible association with the life cycle
    - May be more than decorative, intended to be read together
  - The Destruction of Thera
    - Impact from the volcanic explosion may have reached Crete, maybe leading to the collapse of the Minoan culture
      - Possibly supported by Greek myth => Atlantis
    - Volcanic disruption may be resulted in destruction of coastal resources and ash may have caused widespread famine and social breakdown
      - The weakened state of Crete created an opening for the Mycenaeans to take control
      - Theory is wrong
        - Marine-style pottery not found on Thera, although others are => suggests Marine-style pottery postdates Thera's destruction
          - Maritime trade patterns shifted, but did not terminate
        - Ash desposits in Pseira fall below buildings that show evidence of continuing civilization
        - Various sources also place the eruption too early to have been the cause for Minoan society's collapse
        - Dates may correspond to the end of the Old Palace period
          - Impact of the eruption may have precipitated a total systems failure, breaking down the economy
          - Elites still would've reasserted older, and a new palatial period would see the recovery of the society
- The End of Minoan Culture
  - General agreement that most Minoan sites, both palatial and lower down the hierarchy of size and complexity, suffered catastrophic destruction that put an end to their complex system
    - This destruction may have spread over a period of 50 years => not a single invasion/uprising
    - The people responded with pastoralism
  - The destruction horizon was primarily caused by the arrival of the Mycenaeans
    - Debate over whether there was an active process of "Mycenaeanization"
- Interpreting the Past
  - Our appreciation of Bronze Age Crete is structured by the work of Arthur Evans



## Reading 3: Mycenae: Rich in Gold

- Schliemann and the Creation of the Bronze Age
  - Schliemann's work at Troy and Mycenae changed the way we saw archaeology and Homer's poems
  - Schliemann's dishonesty creates a cloud of doubt around his discovery
    - Falsification of records, theft, manufacturing of archaeological material, etc.
  - Discoveries at Mycenae have revolutionized the scholarly world's understanding of Homer
    - Proof of a wealthy ruler's fortress matches Homer's description of Agamemnon's home
    - Historians end up using the term "Mycenaean" to describe the entirety of Greek civilization in the Late Bronze Age
    - Schliemann can be said to have given the poems of Homer a tangible materiality
    - Aided by the fact that Mycenae had never disappeared fully from history
    - Also supplied evidence for the place of the Mycenaeans in the larger world of the eastern Mediterranean
- The Origins of the People of the Shaft Graves
  - Mycenaeans were likely a society ruled by a warrior aristocracy
  - Carved scenes resembling carvings found in Egypt connect Mycenae to a world of cultural contact, much like the Minoans
  - Mycenaean culture is difficult to reconstruct - foreign invaders? indigenous?
  - Mycenaean wealth in gold creates another mystery
    - The Argolid (heartland of the Mycenaean world) was not rich in mineral wealth
    - Crete
      - Theory that gold was obtained from conquering the Minoans
      - Gold vessels are more rare on Crete, and stylistically, the 2 civilizations don't share much overlap
    - Egypt
      - Theory that Mycenaean warriors were paid by Egyptian pharaohs for mercenary services
        - Mycenaeans lack a naval presence and the Hyksos' control of the region between Mycenae and Egypt would have made military action difficult
    - Romania
      - Gold mining in Romania as a good for trade
      - Discovery of Aegean goods in Transylvania acts as evidence of a profitable exchange network between southern Greece and the Danube basin
        - Continued expansion into central Europe
        - Mycenaeans were better positioned to take advantage of this trade network than the Minoans
          - Minoan Crete to the south and east in the Mediterranean and Levant
          - Mycenaean Greece towards the north
          - Boundaries would change in the Late Bronze Age
- The Mycenaean World
  - From the middle of the second millennium BC, the Mycenaeans had developed a complex society that controlled much of southern and central Greece
  - Life in the Mycenaean centers
    - Region outside the citadel has revealed evidence of roads, dams ,bridges, and building complexes, demonstrating that Mycenae wasn't a lone, isolated mountain citadel, but the center of an urban environment
    - Specialized trade and manufacturing carried on under the protection of the palace and within the walls of the citadel
    - Discovery of Korphos-Kalamianos shows us that Mycenaean settlements were not always organized around palaces and citadels
      - Possibly associated with the exploitation of pastoral resources in the hinterland
    - Discovery of Pylos shows a lack of fortification walls and a center for redistribution, not unlike Cretan palaces
  - Mycenaean Industry and Labor
    - Major industries included perfume and textile manufacturing
      - High scale of activity
    - We can see that Pylos and other Mycenaean centers participated in the trade network that tied the Aegean into a larger world of commodity exchange
    - Palaces had specialized metalworkers who made silver, gold, and copper vessels and jewelry
      - Personnel also included potters, weavers, dyers, artists, and scribes
    - Tablets also show evidence of the Mycenaean elite and social hierarchy
      - Shows manufacturing as a result of slave labor
      - Tablets show evidence of a surprisingly complex and sophisticated society
        - Many social strata
        - Economic activity occurs on a scale that exceeds the modest palaces and halls described by Homer
    - Archaeological work at Lakonia reveal a palace that would have been a major Mycenaean center of considerable size and power
      - Evidence of large-scale weapons manufacturing
      - If Homeric mythology is to be taken into account, this palace may correspond with the palace of Menelaus and Helen
        - Should understanding of poetry enrich our understanding of archaeology?
  - Linear B: Solving the Riddle
    - There were strong affinities between Mycenaean culture and that of Crete
      - Most readily demonstrated by the presence of Minoan artifacts in Mycenaean burials and domestic settings, suggesting that the Mycenaeans favored Minoan styles
      - Some stylistic differences do separate the two civilizations
      - True connections cannot be answered by archaeology
        - Mycenaeans may have descended from the Cretans or adopted Cretan styles in their society
    - Relations between Mycenae and Crete were strongest in the Linear B tablets discovered in both civilizations
      - Alice Kober establishes the basic syllabic structure of the language and that Linear B was inflected
      - Michael Ventris works off of Kober's work and deciphers the language, showing it was Greek
        - Work shows that the language of the Mycenaeans was Greek and that place names inscribed in Linear B correspond with known toponyms
    - Translation offers no poems or literary texts
      - Invaluable as a source of information about the economic conditions and political organization of the Mycenaean world
        - Ex: evidence of ritual slaughter and feast, which would continue to be the backbone for Greek sacrifice and religious practice for centuries
        - Demonstrate that communities were established between major centers of power, and would communicate with these central authorities
          - Tablets give us a view of a highly organized state apparatus
            - Palace acts as both the symbolic, ritual center, and as the central node in the economic network
            - System based on a balance between the production, storage, and redistribution of staple goods and the manufacturing, trade, and consumption of luxury items
- Mycenaean Knossos
  - After the palaces were destroyed a second time, most palaces were not used as ceremonial or administrative centers
    - Knossos was an exception - it returned to its role as the center of a redistributive economy
  - Use of Linear B at Knossos implies that it was occupied by Greeks, not Cretans
    - Cretans would have used Linear A
    - More evidence that mainland Greeks were the cause of the destruction of the Cretan palaces, likely in an invasion
      - Backed up by evidence of competing power between Minoans and Mycenaeans
      - Backed up by the myth of Theseus => villainizes the Cretans and justifies an invasion of Crete
        - Alteration of the bull cult of the Minoans
      - Discovery of more Linear B tablets suggests an overlap with the Mycenaeans' occupation of Crete and the period of time in which they used Linear B to record economic documents on the mainland
        - Continuity of function of writing suggests a cooperation between Mycenaean elite and their new subjects
      - DNA evidence shows an influx of people from the Peloponnese and central Greece to the Cretan population
  - Mycenaeans would've encountered a social apparatus far more complex and developed than their own
    - Developed a form of state organization and control that clearly mimicked the Cretan model
    - Mycenaeans became the kings of principalities that developed the same model of storage, manufacturing, luxury trade, and redistribution that had been the hallmark of Minoan Crete
- Troy and Homer
  - Bronze Age can also be reconstructed using mythology
    - Most notably, Troy
  - Excavation reveals Troy clearly had many phases of occupation on the same site
    - Time period identifies Homer's Troy as Troy VI or VII
      - Troy VI shows no evidence of collapse due to warfare, therefore most scholars identify Homer's Troy with Troy VII
    - Korfmann claims to have discovered evidence that Troy VI and VII were 10x larger than originally thought
      - Would make Troy one of the larger trade emporia of the Late Bronze Age
      - Location makes it a valuable trade point between the Danubian zone and the Aegean
    - Kolb dismisses Korfmann's interpretation
      - Claims few luxury items from the proposed trade routes
      - No archive has been found associated with the citadel of Troy VI or VII, unlike other great palatial centers
      - Most scholars agree with Korfmann
    - Hittite correspondence suggests that many elements of Homer's poems derive from the conditions at the end of the Bronze Age
      - Question for historians is what aspects of the poems reflect historical reality and what elements are fiction?
      - Poems initially passed down orally means there is a large gap between the events they describe and when the poems were finally written down
        - Especially impossible to describe social institutions and abstractions accurately
        - Governmental practices are likely to be associated with the poet's own time
        - Specific descriptions that delighted the audience were likely to be retained
  - Likely that Troy was sacked and, due to the upheavals of the time, the Mycenaeans were involved
    - Would've been because of the wealth of the strategically located city
    - The absence of the Hittites, which would've been a large power at the time of the Mycenaeans, leads to the belief that Homer's accounts of the Trojan War do not accurately describe history
- The Collapse of Mycenaean Culture
  - Following Homer's poems, the fall of Troy would've signified the beginning of the end of the Bronze Age
  - Major Mycenaean sites collapsed along a horizon of destruction, similar to the earlier case of Minoan Crete
    - Climate change creates a collapse of the Mycenaean economy
    - Evidence of foreign invasion
    - Changes in battle technology, leading to a shift from chariot-based combat to infantry combat, resulting in chariot-based forces of Mycenaean elites losing their grip on power
      - All explanations may have played some role
  - As disasters hit Mycenaean power centers, construction projects and Linear B tablets imply potential threat of siege from the sea
    - Fear not unwarranted due to the presence of a loose coalition of tribes that exploited tensions between the great eastern Mediterranean states to plunder, known as the Sea People



## Reading 4: The Iron Age

- Center and Periphery in the Early Iron Age
  - Homer's poems recast the Bronze Age into a world of heroes
    - The world described in Homeric poems is much closer to the Early Iron Age rather than the time of Minoan Crete and the Mycenaeans
    - An example of Homer's halls exists at Lefkandi on the island of Euboia
      - Illustrative of how a society ruled by chieftians was emerging in the Proto-Geometric period
      - Shortly after its construction, it was used in burial rituals, a practice resembling the Mycenaean world
      - Has forced scholars to re-examine the Greek world after the collapse of the Mycenaeans
        - Previously assumed that the Greek world had returned to a world dominated by poor farmers and herders
        - Palaces did cease to function, but the aftermath was contained
        - Recent excavations have shown a continuity of settlement from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age
    - The people of Iron Age Greece actively created memories of their past (Trojan War) and recast those stories with heroes with similar values to the Greek rulers of the Iron Age
      - Bronze Age tombs were also revisited and venerated in late periods
        - Tombs acted as a connection to a heroic past
    - Homeric poems shaped the Iron Age by connecting the present and heroic past in narrative
  - Society and Identity in the Iron Age
    - Descendants of the hero of Lefkandi participated in a Mediterranean trade network
      - Shows evidence that within 100 years of the end of the palaces, the eastern periphery of the Mycenaean world had recovered
      - Palaces weren't restored, a new form of social organization would develop
    - The oikos or household was a patrilinear family unit centered on the big man
      - The men styled themselves as rulers
      - Homeric poems were shaped by the highly competitive society they dominated
        - Hieratic states and redistributive economies of the Bronze Age make little impact on Homer's stories
        - We rely on Homeric poems to reconstruct the social world of this big man society, supplemented by material culture
      - Clear signs of communal organization can be found in Early Iron Age communities
    - At some settlements, multiple hamlets appear to have existed in close proximity to one another
      - Points to competing clans, each dominated by a chieftain
      - Scholars see this society as comprised of a warrior elite controlling large numbers of dependent farmers
        - Weapons and figurines of warriors dating back to this period are common
          - Warrior figurine from Karditsa
    - Terracotta figurine from the Toumba cemetery has been suggested to represent Cheiron, a centaur who raised Achilles
      - Insuifficient evidence, but acts as a reminder that the period was richly imaginative
      - Monsters and hybrids of Greek myth were definitely present during the Iron Age
        - Centaurs located on the edge of the Mycenaean world
        - With Mycenaean Greece long gone, the south would still be associated with advanced civilization, while the north was tied to wildness
    - Mykonos pithos depicting the Trojan Horse
      - Reminds us that the stories told in the epic cycle remained alive in the imagination of the Greeks for hundreds of years, despite the historical events they depicted having occurred long ago
      - Points to the importance of Homer's stories
        - Also reflected by "Nestor's cup" found at the Greek colony of Pithekoussai
    - The Iron Age saw its own significant cultural developments
      - Production of monumental funerary markers in Athens
        - Vessels were comprised of the ekphora, the procession that escorted the body to the burial, and the prothesis, a depiction of the body laid out, with others engaging in lamentations around the corpse
        - Opportunity for great families to assert their status
    - Shift from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age
      - Widespread upheavals in the eastern Mediterranean around 1150 BC
        - May have jeopardized the regular international trade
        - Centralized control broke down in palatial centers
        - Linear B lost forever, and Greece would remain without a writing system for 300 years
        - Reliance on oral poetry to link to the past and blend with the new Iron Age
      - Iron Age was a society ruled by elites who participated in international trade
        - Possible monopolization of iron, the new preferred material for weapons
      - New social order would develop, based on the domination of a warrior elite who modeled themselves on Homer's heroes
      - Greek culture would be introduced to new challenges, but Homer would still give the Greeks their identity
  - Heroes and Villains
    - The Early Iron Age saw memories of a heroic past shape the present
      - Basileis asserted their status as leaders and warriors
      - Families and households fashioned elite identities by practicing tomb and ancestor cult
      - Homeric poems expressed a complex attitude towards the past
    - The Nostoi told of the returns of the heroes of Troy
      - Tales of shipwreck, betrayal, and death
      - Odysseus' homecoming contrasted with that of Agamemnon, who returned and was killed by Klytaimnsetra and Aigisthos
      - Emphasizes that, despite the use of the epic poems' by princes to claim heroic descent, they were often expressive of a society dissatisfied with the rule of kings
      - Rudimentary depictions of justice and governance; concern with the operation of authority
        - Reflected in the work of eighth-century poet, Hesiod
        - "The strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must"
    - Poems often leave the audience aware of how inadequate the Homeric code is as the basis of a social contract
      - Odysseus' return home involved the slaughter of the Suitors and the hanging of the servant girls => continuation of the cycle of violence
      - Despite the magnificence of Homeric heroism on the battlefield, it threatened to condemn Iron Age society to eternal warfare
        - Can the code that nurtures warriors be reconciled with peace?
- Polis and Ethnos in the Eighth Century
  - During the 8th century, the polis/city-state emerged as the distinctive form of Greek social and political life
    - Developments contributed to the culture of Archaic Greece
      - Age of the first Olympics
      - Age of the first overseas trade emporia
      - Beginning of a diaspora of Greeks throughout the Mediterranean and beyond
      - Age of the first acquisition of the Greek alphabet
  - The rise of the city-state
    - Evidence at old Smyrna and Corinth, where clusters of houses and specialized production areas suggest the growth of complex social organization
      - Cluster of villages around the later agora/marketplace witnessed a rapid increase in population
      - Corinthian pottery began to be traded far afield, suggesting a vigorous commercial life tied to the community
      - Profited from its position at the intersection of the Corinthian and Saronic Gulfs, allowing for the easy export of material both east and west
      - Colonies dispatched from Corinth by members of the same family, suggestive of oligarchic control by the Bacchiads
    - The polis was not the sole form of social organization to emerge from the Iron Age
      - Aggregates of communities asserted a common ethnic identity, known as ethne
        - Many of these formed political federations known as koina
        - Ex: the Aitolians of western Greece all claimed to be descendants of Aitolos
        - Varied from identifying as primarily religious networks to important regional organizations
  - Monumental Temples and the Rule of Law
    - Closely connected with the increase in urban agglomerations
    - Attest to the importance of religious and cult activity in the eighth and seventh centuries
      - Many Early Archaic sanctuaries were the result of transforming the houses of rulers and the elite into temples of the gods
    - In the 6th century BC, the Greeks would go on to begin building temples out of limestone and marble
      - Scholars note the evolutionary development in temple architecture
      - Represents a fundamental shift in the nature of social hierarchy
    - As gods emerged as the central focus of these communities, kings declined in importance
      - Communities took first steps towards establishing regular, codified laws
      - Governance shifted from the basileis to the sovereign decisions of the community
      - At Dreros we see the establishment of legal authority in the community
        - Executive power would rotate and boards of magistrates guaranteed that power wouldn't fall in the hands of a single individual
        - Shift away from the world of kings and Homeric heroes
    - Early Greek lawgivers' stories follow formulaic patterns involving an initial crisis, the appointment of the lawgiver, testing of new laws, and the departure of the lawgiver
      - Seems to suggest that the establishing of laws with the help of the gods or a semi-divine lawgiver was a stage of development that societies needed to endure to survive
    - Early Greek law was primarily procedural, not substantive
      - Laws dictated how an arbitration was to be conducted or what penalty to serve
      - Didn't detail any underlying principles
      - Practical, not theoretical
    - Writing down of laws altered the way they operated
      - People who know laws and expounded on them lost importance
      - Placed emphasis on the law, not the legal expert
      - Regarded as a step towards democracy
- A Greek Diaspora
  - Vigorous commercial activity throughout the Greek world between 750 - 500 BCE
    - Trading north as far as Ukraine
    - Trading south as far as Egypt
    - Eventually established permanent colonies in trade destinations
      - Done as a result of population growth pressure at home, resulting in a need for new land?
      - Done to acquire trade opportunities, giving rise to the foundation of colonies?
    - What general conditions led to the Greeks leaving their ancestral home?
  - Some places dedicated to trade represent the mercantile drive that took Greeks to the farthest reaches of the Mediterranean world
    - Evidence of land divisions at these sites imply that land was a valuable resource for settlers at the time
      - Land was surveyed and plots of equal size were apportioned to the first settlers
    - Colonists may have been dispatched by some mother-city, but these colonies were founded by waves of settlers
    - Trade and land went hand in hand
    - Agricultural colonies cannot be classified separately from trading colonies
    - Colonies in the region known as Magna Graecia have been surveyed, showing that most of them were planned from the outset
      - Desire to honor the gods, setting aside areas for worship
      - Need to provide land for new settlers
        - Allocation raises questions of status and fairness => settlers needed to have equal portions of land
        - Division into lots (kleroi) of plethra => small plots, evidence that settlers planned on supplementing survival with land holdings out of town and trade
    - Central area set aside to house the temples of the gods and an agora (public space)
      - Roads ran out from this central area, dividing land into equal plots
      - Orientation of buildings shows initial planning, unlike the organic communities of the mainland
  - Communities, Foundations, and Identities
    - Colonies confirmed the authority of a founder and lawgiver, resembling Zeus, but also helped articulate a notion of equality
    - Debate that the idea of formal colonial expeditions sent from the mother-city (metropolis) is a retrojection from later times to provide legitimacy to the colonies' founding
      - Intertwining of myth and history
      - The founding of Cyrene has multiple  different variations, scattered across Greece
      - These stories create affinities based on goodwill, fictional ties of blood, and shared episodes in the tales
        - Narrative linked communities across the Aegean world
    - Greeks forced to ask and answer the basic questions of social life
      - What constitutes a community?
      - How shall it be governed?
      - What authority will give its laws force?
      - How shall we live?
  - Delphi and Greek Identity
    - The story of Cyrene's founding points to the central role of Delphi
    - Accounts of colonial foundations commonly feature natural disasters, brought upon the subjects of the stories by the oracle in response to some wrongdoing
      - Communities of Archaic Greece were compelled to seek the active guidance of the oracle for help on these matters
      - Centers on Apollo, the god of oracular communication and who led many colonial expeditions to their new home
    - Apollo's authority is used to give legitimacy to Cyrene and many other colonies
      - His presence is found in lawmaking as well
    - Apollo's involvement in every aspect of the Greek diaspora shaped the community's Greek identity
      - Mentality of "us" and "them"
      - Mention of the indigenous people prior to Greek settlement is rare
        - They were demonized, projected into the Greek imagination as monsters
        - Indication of this is present in art and temples
        - Giants, amazons, and hybrid monsters served as a reminder of the dangers and threats lurking on the borders of the known world
        - Promotion of constant hostility towards others
- "Orientalizing" and Eastern Influence
  - Ideas and motifs from the eastern Mediterranean entered Greek culture during the Orientalizing phase
    - Greek response to this new cultural interaction shown by exotic animals and strange hybrids on Corinthian pottery
  - These new ideas and motifs were used to help define a sense of Greekness
    - They also materially changed the nature of Greek culture itself
    - Greeks absorbed the stories, poems, and technologies of the eastern people
      - This is especially shown when contrasting Hesiod's poetry with Homer's
        - Story of Ouranos/Kronos/Zeus resembles Hurrian and Hittite poems
        - Story of Zeus and Typhoeus resembles the Babylonian story of Marduk and Tiamat
  - Near East stories place the rivalries of various kingdoms and city-states of the ancient Near-East into narrative form
    - They also draw on deeply rooted psychological fears
    - Many draw from astrological significance and the constellations
  - The mixing of stories with the Near East also influenced by the adoption of an Eastern alphabet and the reinvention of writing in the Greek world
  - The Reinvention of Writing
    - Linear B fell out of use with the fall of palatial culture and the end of the Bronze Age
      - It remained absent from the Greek world for 300+ years afterwards
      - Since Linear B was used to monitor the economic system of palaces, the downfall of that economic system resulted in the downfall of the script
    - In 720 BCE, the Greeks adopted a writing system from the northwest Semitic Phoenicians
      - Earliest written Greek turns up where Greeks and Phoenicians traded, adapted to ease the exchange of goods
      - Possible that bilingual children of marriages between Greeks and Phoenicians would have adopted the script of one language to represent the sounds of the other
      - Practice caught on very quickly
    - Writing's widespread use has been underscored by excavations at Methone
      - Dozens of vessels inscribed with Greek names and lines of verse found in the Ypogeio (Underground)
        - Vessels included both transport vessels and drinking cups
      - Provenance of the material attests to the importance of Methone
        - Profited from its strategic location => interior rich in timber, metal reserves from Macedonia, point of entry to Aegean trade network, etc.
      - Among the earlies pieces of written Greek
      - Some cases used to label transport vessels, in other cases, it's used to identify the owner of the drink
        - Use in trade and in the symposium
        - Would later be used to write down the Homeric poems
      - Reveals a Greek culture tightly bound into Aegean and Mediterranean worlds characterized by intense degrees of interaction
      - Cultural exchange between Greeks and non-Greeks
- The Olympics
  - The diaspora is accompanied by an opposite movement towards asserting Greek identity
    - Found expression through the cultural institution of the Olympics
  - Founded in 776 BC by Herakles
  - For 1000+ years, it would remain one of the key institutions for determining inclusion within the community of Greeks
    - By extension, it determined exclusion for those that weren't Greek
  - Held every 4 years at the foot of Kronos Hill, adjacent to the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia
    - Region is far from the direct control of any major power
  - Initially dominated by Spartans
    - They didn't attempt to take control of the sanctuary
    - Emerged as a panhellenic sanctuary, where Greeks from anywhere could mix freely
    - Critical in the shaping and emergence of Greek identity
  - Competitors reinforced their common Greek identity by competing with one another
    - Only Greeks competed with Greeks
    - Reinforced by shared culture, shared language, and shared myths
  - The Olympics were a sacred event, conducted for the glory of Zeus as much as it was for the glory of the athletes
    - Month leading up to the games was a time of truce throughout Greece (ekecheiria), during which wars were suspended
  - Core events remained fundamental over the Olympics' years of existence
    - Stadion - straight sprint the length of the stadium
    - Diaulos - sprint to the end and back
    - Dolichos - long distance race of 20 stadia
    - Included a series of combat competitions: boxing, wrestling, pankration
    - Pentathlon - discus, javelin, standing jump, running, and wrestling
  - Early in its existence, there was a strong association between aristocratic status and Olympic victory
    - Many victors were dynastic rulers on the mainland, with their Olympic wins bound up with claims to legitimacy in their families
    - Pindar's poems cast these Olympic victors as Homeric heroes
    - Victory is a confirmation of arete (virtue or excellence), affirming and extending the family's nobility
    - Reward for victory is kleos aphthiton (undying fame), the same thing sought after by Homeric heroes
    - Possible that the Olympics began as a way for aristocrats to demonstrate their prowess and to assert the claim that they embodied the virtues found in Homer's poems
  - Over time, the aristocratic character of the games disappeared and professional athletes emerged
    - Rewards became material, like cash or food
    - These professional athletes still exerted enormous influence in their communities
      - Served as political and military leaders and worshipped as demigods after their deaths
    - They were honored for their accomplishments and revered for their powers



## Reading 5: The Archaic Age: Sparta

- The Archaic Period (c. 700 - 480 BCE) was one of increasing prosperity, but also rising tension
- Archaic Crisis: Wealth, Strife, and Tyranny
  - Greeks experienced long and sustained contact with other cultures
    - Goods and ideas coming into Greece
    - Greeks establishing themselves around the Mediterranean
    - This penetration of culture would become profound in the Archaic Age
  - Greeks experience an increase in trade in the search for resources, land, and luxury items
    - To the Greeks, the wider Mediterranean world was a place of communities connected by trade, commerce, and the establishment of colonies, but also a world of wonders, threats, and anxieties brought about by contact with others
      - Represented by the widespread use of monsters in Greek mythology at the time
      - Touched on by the *Odyssey*
  - Contact with the wider world prompted important changes on the mainland
    - City-states were growing larger and regional powers (Athens, Thebes, and Sparta) began to emerge
    - Wealth, status, competition, and rivalry (aristocratic and between communities) become more prevelant
  - Corinth
    - Located on a narrow isthmus that separated the Saronic Gulf and Corinthian Gulf
      - Possessed a well-fortified acropolis above the city
      - Two separate harbors from east to west that allowed for large amounts of wealth to flow through the city
    - In the early Archaic Period, Corinth was under the control of the Bacchiads
      - Supplied kings (later annual magistrates) and colonial leaders who founded new colonies
    - In the mid-7th century BCE, Kypselos seized power and ruled as a tyrant
      - This pattern repeated in many parts of Greece, where tyrants used the social and political tensions of the age to seize control of their communities
      - This trend was originally seen as a symptom of the disorder and weakness of the early city-states due to the negative connotations associated with tyranny
        - In reality, many of these tyrants acted as lawgivers and had relatively benign rules
        - This may have even helped put an end to regional factionalism
        - Provided a generation of stability that freed the city-states from social upheaval and increased economic prosperity
      - Attests to the political upheavals affecting many Greek city-states in the Archaic period
  - Poetry on stasis (internal civil conflict)
    - In many communities, we hear of men killed or exiled due to factional disputes within the emerging city-states
    - Archaic period classified as one where more and more people were subject to the compulsions of a few, leading to class struggles
      - Point to the fact that men called the aristoi, which formed the elite class, can now be identified in poetry
      - We also hear of subject groups (the penestai of Thessaly, klarotai in Crete, and helots in Sparta)
    - Actual evidence of civil disorder points to it stemming from competing groups of aristocrats, clans not classes
      - Lesbos, Halikarnassos, Megara, etc.
      - Vertical vs. horizontal divisions
  - Euboia
    - Commerce flourished, leading to the success of Chalkis and Eretria
    - Increased prosperity led to competition between the neighboring communities
    - The Battle of the Lelantine Plain was fought between the two citiees
      - Remembered as one of the epochal events of the Archaic period
      - For the next 400 years, Greek interstate relations would be comprised of a continuous series of wars
        - May be due to the deep-seated heroic values of epic, leading to an inability to develop loyalty to any group beyond the immediate family/clan/community
  - The establishment of a Greek colony in Egypt brought the art of stone-cutting and sculpting to Greek culture
  - Emergence of a monetized economy
    - Coins made it possible for trade to bypass the process of barter => goods no longer needed to be exchanged directly
    - Greek accounts attribute the creation of coinage to Pheidon of Argos
    - This shift threatened to replace aristocratic birth with monetary wealth as the highest good to which an individual could aspire
      - Money and heroism at odds
- Early Sparta
  - Throughout the history of Sparta, the citizens have been strongly hostile towards tyrants (misotyrannos)
    - Claim that their political and communal life was based on eunomia (good order), which can be attributed to the lawgiver Lykourgos
    - Sparta followed a vastly different trajectory to other Greek communities when it came to their social and political contract
    - Spartans emphasized a strict social hierarchy, topped by the warrior class known as the Spartiates
  - Geography played a role in Sparta's unique social organization
    - Cut off from neighboring lands by mountains, leading to a sense of physical isolation that allowed Sparta to avoid the stasis of other communities
    - Spartans applied themselves to a strict and unyielding code of conduct that was designed to raise generations of warriors
  - Difficult for historians to separate the actual history of Sparta with the mythologization of its traditions
    - "The Spartan Mirage"
    - Terse in speech, stand in battle until the end, prized honor over life, and trained under the harshest conditions
    - Use the material culture of the region to shed light on its early history
      - Palace at Aghios Vasileios proved that the region of Lakonia was integrated into the Mycenaean world
        - Further evidence implies that the culture of Bronze Age Lakonia resembles the Bronze Age culture of other regions during the time of the Mycenaeans
      - After the Bronze Age, Lakonia was affected by the same changes that led to the fall of other Mycenaean centers
        - Spartan tradition associates these upheavals with the return of the Herakleidai, the descendants of Herakles
        - Historians choose to see this as evidence of societies in transition
      - The society that would shape in Sparta looked very different than in other regions
        - Unification of Athens leads to a fully developed city center, but civic buildings/city center in Sparta are hard to identify
        - The physical grandeur of Athens leads people to overestimate its power, while the opposite was true of Sparta
  - Spartan Religion
    - At Amyklai, the Spartans engaged in the worship of a hero, Hyakinthos, and the god Apollo
      - Pairing of hero and god wasn't unique, but the monument built in honor of them was extraordinary
    - Helen of Troy
      - Athenian depictions of Helen were highly negative, while she was honored as a heroine and goddess in Sparta
      - She received sacrifices and dedications at the Menelaion
    - The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia
      - More than 100,000 lead figurines have been found here, depicting hoplites, female worshippers, and animals
        - Probably dedications to the goddess in recognition of her help
      - Terracotta masks that portray grotesque faces representing demons
      - Goddess looks not unlike Phoenician goddesses, possibly pointing to early connections between Sparta and the East
        - Some scholars point to this as evidence that the cult of Artemis Orthia was brought to Sparta by Phoenicians
        - Material evidence points to a connection with workshops on Crete
      - Ritual where boys were charged with stealing large wheels of cheese from the altar while being savagely whipped
        - Belief that the blood they shed would appease the goddess
    - Temple architecture
      - Most Greek temples were peripteral, meaning the central chamber was surrounded by an external colonnade of columns
      - Lakonian temples were non-peripteral, appearing simpler and less ornamental
    - Spartan practice represents a variation on norms found throughout the Greek world
      - Even Greeks believed that Sparta was distinctive
      - Possible that the panhellenic view of Greece that has come from the Homeric poems obscures the true degree of local variation in Greek culture and religion
- Spartan Exceptionalism
  - Possible that a series of wars with the Messenians led to the Spartans taking a diverging path to building their society
    - Foundation of the Spartan colony of Taras at Tarentum around 700 BCE
      - Tradition claims that this colony was founded by the Parthenioi, men who were born to Spartan women while their husbands were away at the Messenian wars
        - Questionable legitimacy and status resulted in them being deported to a new colony
      - Helps us track down the time period of the Messenian wars
    - Second Messenian War proved to be a turning point for Sparta's internal development
      - Having defeated the Messenians, the Spartans decided to permanently subjugate them, treating them as a servile class in their own territory
        - Throughout the rest of Greek history, the conflict between two warring units would essentially end when the campaigning season of the war came to an end
      - Spartans annexed the territory to Lakonia
        - Land was worked by the slaves of Sparta (helots), a population which included Messenia's original owners
        - Transformed Messenia and made it possible/necessary for Sparta to become a society dedicated to the raising of elite warriors
        - Ever-present threat of a helot uprising
        - Every institution of Spartan society was directed towards the creation of a warrior-elite, whose existence depended on the continued subjugation of the helots
  - Spartiate training
    - Spartan boys taken from their families at the age of seven and raised with other boys their own age
      - Age-class system called the agoge
      - Boys encouraged to steal, live by their wits, and resist weakness
        - Later accounts state this code strained credulity
    - Boys graduated from their adolescence into the ranks of the Spartan army
      - Continued training and serving
      - Lived in the syssitia, which contained 15-20 members from all age groups
        - New, 12 year-old members introduced by older lovers (men around the age of 22)
        - Since the group included 1-2 generations of older lovers, they were unusually cohesive, with deep bonds
        - Membership required contributions of both game and staples like barley and wheat
          - Failure to make these contributions resulted in explusion/demotion
        - System may represent an early attempt to use state regulation and intervention as a way of helping the community survive the threat of crop failure
      - Turned the top tier of Spartan society into professional warriors
    - Spartans said to have close ties with the Cretans
      - Shared institution of the syssitia
      - Both speakers of a Doric dialect of Greek
      - Tradition that the Spartan lawgiver Lykourgos had traveled to Crete to learn how to draft a set of laws for Sparta
      - Sparta and Crete said to have enjoyed adelphoi nomoi ("kindred law codes")
    - Other institutions advertised Sparta's divergence from Greek norms
      - Most Greek states saw young men go through military training designed to prepare them for taking their place in the hoplite phalanx of citizen warriors
        - These youths were known as ephebes, and served specialized training and particular service
      - In Sparta, the youth served in an organization known as the krypteia, which functioned as a secret police
        - They acted to terrorize the helot population
        - Killed helots found outside after dark
  - Spartans were morbidly afraid of innovation from beyond
    - The free flow of ideas, encouraged by debate, disputation, and discourse would become a hallmark of Athenian culture
    - Open discussion discouraged in the repressive oligarchy of Sparta
      - Aidos (reserve) was prized as a virtue and used rhetorically to distinguish Spartans from others
    - Spartans would periodically expel all foreigners in a practice known as xenelasia
      - Athenians sent to aid the Spartans after an earthquake, told to leave months later due to Spartan fear of Athenian thinking
  - The Great Rhetra
    - In Sparta, kingship was retained long after most Greek city-states abolished kings
      - Ruled through the historical period by two families: the Eurypontids and the Agiads
      - Spartan army nearly always led by one of the kings
      - Known as the archagetai
    - The Great Rhetra was an oracle given by Delphi to Lykourgos when he sought the god's help in establishing a constitutional code for Sparta
      - Heated debate over the oracle's contents
      - Division of the state into tribes (phylai) fits later Spartan organization, so it seems likely it may have existed in the early days
        - Same with the division into obai (villages)
      - The Gerousia was a senate, made up of Spartan elders, and the structure was a common feature ion Archaic communities
    - What social tensions led to the shaping of such a constitution?
      - A way of moderating aristocratic competition by channeling it into fixed and predictable institutions?
      - Aristotle believed that Sparta was an aristocratic state riven by factions, but also claimed this resulted in demands for the redistribution of land
    - 2 important features
      - No mention of the magistrates (ephors), who were elected in groups of 5 to rule the city's affairs in later periods
        - Contributes to the document's sense of authenticity
      - States clearly that the sovereign power rests with the Damos/people
        - Early Sparta was on the path to democracy and may have developed a system closer to Athens' under different circumstances
        - Suggested that the Gerontes and Kings would be given the power to veto decisions made by the people
    - Reconstruction of Early Sparta's constitutional history
      - 7th century BCE, the Spartan community came to a proto-democratic form of government, where kings remained war leaders and heads of state, while allowing the people (adult male citizens) to have final legislative power
      - 6th century BCE, after the Messenian wars, aristocratic power and privilege reasserted control over Sparta
        - Used the threat of helot revolt to fashion a closed political and military elite
        - Ephors oversaw political decision-making
        - Attention directed towards the military training of the elite
- Spartan Culture
  - Focus on military excellence skewed the development of Spartan society
    - Spartans excelled in athletic contests
  - The state of permanent internal warfare against the helot population combined to bring about the downfall of Spartan society
    - Vigorous cultural traditions of the Archaic period vs. the wasteland of Spartan culture in the Classical period
      - Prior to the Persian Wars, Spartan craftsmen distinguished themselves in metalwork
  - Sparta excelled in ivory
    - Dedications carved from ivory in the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia
  - Early Spartans were also innovators and masters in poetry
    - Alkman produced rich, complex hymns for performance at ritual festivals in the 7th century BCE
      - Blend of the astrological and erotic
    - Imagination of the Archaic Spartans was rich and beautiful, in common with their material culture
    - Tyrtaios wrote poetry that encapsulated the martial ideologies that were dominant in the Spartan world
      - Reconfigures the Homeric code for a new age
      - Deliberate evocation of battle as the arena by which men must test themselves
  - Like Spartan religion, not many aspects of Spartan culture were exceptional
    - Many features of Spartan life were paralleled in other states (especially Dorian)
      - Slaves/serfs, political institutions, status as equals (homoioi), etc.
    - They did diverge from the patterns of cultural and political development that we find in most other Greek city-states, likely due to the relentless militarization of Spartan society
  - Women in Sparta
    - View that women in Sparta were more powerful than women in other Greek city-states
      - Could inherit, own, and administer property => seen as a weakness of the Spartan system
    - Claim that Spartans practiced a particular form of polygamy, where women might have more than one husband (polyandry)
      - Contributes to the antiquated view that Spartan women were outspoken, promiscuous, independent, and wielded too much power
      - Aristotle concludes that, due to this, Sparta suffered from oliganthropia, or a shortage of men
        - Women were indirectly the cause of Sparta's downfall
    - Approaches to this topic often tainted by the evaluation of Spartans in light of contemporary values and biases
    - More realistically, Spartans likely participated in selective breeding/eugenics
    - Fertile women were prized in the aristocratic society since they could give birth to heirs and preserve the lineage
      - Shared women leads to fewer lines of descent and less pressure to divide the family's property between multiple lines
    - Militarization of the society leads Spartan men to delegate household control to their women, leaving them with much greater autonomy than in other parts of Greece
      - Without their contribution, their society couldn't have functioned
- Sparta and the Peloponnese
  - Despite mountain ranges separating Lakonia from other regions, regional conflict occupied the Spartans throughout the Archaic period
  - The Spartans were equally as preoccupied with the Argive as with the Messenians
    - Feuding over territory southwest of Argos (Kynouria/the plain of Thyrea)
    - Led to a battle between 300 of their best warriors, of which the result was ambiguous => Battle of the Champions
    - Long-standing hatred between the two peoples
    - Also fought at Hysiai earlier in the Archaic period and later in the Peloponnesian War
      - Male citizens of Hysiai taken captive and slaughtered in the latter battle
  - Treatment of Peloponnesian neighbors was frequently confrontational
  - Despite this, Sparta managed a loose alliance of Peloponnesian states called the Peloponnesian League
    - Treated much more leniently than the Athenians treated their allies
    - States further away from Sparta remained more loyal and were treated with more respect, while closer states were in a much more precarious position
    - Desire of the Spartans to amass as much land as possible and subjugate as many Greek states as possible throughout the 6th century BCE
      - Rid Corinth of tyrants, securing a wealthy ally
      - Support the Elian claim to Olympia, securing another powerful ally
      - Direct military intervention pacified the states of Messenia, Argos, and Arcadia
  - Used religious sanctuaries to demonstrate their territorial ambitions
  - At the end of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta would be turned on by neighboring states, which were then defeated



## Reading 6: The Archaic Age: Athens

- 



## Summary 1: Why Study the Greeks?

- Cultures in Dialogue
  - Across a range of human activities, from medicine and architecture to poetry and mathematics, contemporary western culture reveals a powerful connection to the world of the ancient Greeks
- Truth and beauty
  - The Greeks' preoccupation with truth and beauty are particularly relevant in today's world, saturated as it is by pop culture
- Democracy, Ancient and Modern
  - The complexity of our relationship to the Greeks is conveyed by different ideas of democracy: participatory versus representative
  - The paradox of envisioning an ideal society while recognizing its flaws is another point of contact between the Greeks and us
- Greek Architecture and Philosophy
  - The tension between similarity and difference can be explored in architecture, where similar forms hide different functions
  - In philosophy, we follow paths set by the Greeks, yet in areas of human rights there are deep voids unexplored by the Greeks
- East versus West?
  - The danger of placing the Greeks on a pedestal is that it fits a western-oriented interpretation of history, denigrating other cultures as inferior
  - Modern instances of this demonizing of the Other show that ideologically freighted history remains a danger
- Paideia
  - Just as the Greeks moved towards a more inclusive notion of Greekness, replacing blood with culture, so too we face the challenge of esteeming the Greeks and understanding their accomplishments while still respecting other cultures



## Summary 2: Early Greece and the Minoans: The Labyrinth and the Minotaur

- Greece in the Neolithic: The Origins of Complex Societies
  - From the Franchthi Cave and a number of other sites (including Dikili Tash, Alepotrypa, Sesklo, and Dimini), a picture emerges of gradually increasing social complexity and stratification
  - Successive sites have also been identified at such places as Gournia and Pseira
- The Third Millennium
  - Complex societies appeared in a number of regions around Greece in the third millennium, notably in Attica at Tsepi, on Aegina, and on many of the islands of the Aegean
  - Particularly interesting, but somewhat enigmatic, is the Cycladic culture
- Minoan Crete
  - On Crete, a society emerged based on the great palaces of Knossos, Phaistos, and Malia
  - Palatial culture relied on a redistributive economy
  - The palaces were also religious and cultic centers
- Beyond the Palaces
  - In other parts of Crete, smaller settlements have also been identified at places, such as Gournia and Pseira.
  - Outside Crete, Minoan culture is also on display as far away as Lemnos and Thera
  - Cretan-style bull-jumping is also evident at Avaris in Egypt
- Thera: A Minoan Settlement
  - The richest evidence for Minoan culture and daily life in the Bronze Age comes from Thera
  - Wall paintings reveal a vivid appreciation of nature
  - Some scenes may also depict naval expeditions, calling to mind Homer's poems
- The End of Minoan Culture
  - The theory that Minoan culture was destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption is assessed
  - Gradual incursion by Mycenaean elements is also examined as a possible explanation for the end of Minoan culture
- Interpreting the Past
  - The role of Sir Arthur Evans and the practice of restoration is examined
  - How we imagine the past plays a key role in how we interpret the past



## Summary 3: Mycenae: Rich in Gold

- Schliemann and the Creation of the Bronze Age
  - An obsessive but unscrupulous man, Schliemann uncovered the sites of Troy and Mycenae but left a legacy of dishonesty that raises a question mark over his discoveries
  - Even so, he gave Homer's poems a material context, increasing the likelihood of an historical kernel to the poems
- The Origins of the People of the Shaft Graves
  - The wealth of Mycenae, rich in gold, raises questions regarding the origins of Late Bronze Age Mycenaean culture
  - Some scholars think Mycenaean mercenary were employed by Pharaoh
  - Recent studies point toward trade connections with the Danube basin
- The Mycenaean World
  - The physical remains at Mycenae point to a warrior aristocracy whose power was expressed in monumental architecture: massive walls, imposing relief sculpture, and impressive corbeled tombs
  - Recent work also shows that the citadel was surrounded by a larger settlement
  - Linear B tablets allow us to recreate the highly centralized production, storage and distribution characteristic of the Mycenaean economy
- Mycenaean Knossos
  - Linear B evidence also fits with mythical traditions regarding the relations of Mycenae and Crete in the late Bronze Age
  - The final phase of complex palatial life at Knossos was dominated by Mycenaeans from the mainland
- Troy and Homer
  - The relationship between archaeological evidence and literary evidence is most acute in the so-called Homeric question: do the Homeric poems accurately reveal the world of the Bronze Age, and are the poems' descriptions of the Trojan War reliable?
  - This debate turns on both the formulaic quality of Homer's poetry and the recent controversial interpretation of the material culture of Troy
- The Collapse of Mycenaean Culture
  - The end of the Bronze Age in Greece has been prompted a wide variety of explanations, from climate change to foreign invasion
  - It is likely that there was widespread upheaval around the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC
  - The collapse of Mycenaean palatial culture was symptomatic of a broader systems collapse across the Levant



## Summary 4: The Iron Age

- Center and Periphery
  - In the Iron Age, some former citadels were still occupied but new societies can be seen at such places as Lefkandi
  - At some sites, such as Kalapodi, there is evidence of continuity of cult
  - New communities were dominated by chieftains who saw Homer's heroes as models for their own authority
  - Homer's poems are not relics of the Bronze Age but represent the use of the past in shaping a new identity
- Polis and Ethnos
  - In some parts of Greece the *oikoi*, or households of the elite, coalesced to form larger communities, the first *poleis*, or city-states
  - Other regions retained more dispersed settlements and looser political bonds, identifying as *ethne*, or ethnic units, and sometimes as political federations, or *koina*
  - Temples were often the focal point of early communities. Religious authority helped stabilize these states
  - Rulers' palaces were often transformed into gods' houses
- A Greek Diaspora
  - Colonization and trade are distinctive features of the eighth and seventh centuries
  - Greeks were part of a broader Mediterranean network
  - This cultural contact exposed them to older cultures, stories, languages, and even such phenomena as writing
  - Delphi played a key role in endorsing Greek colonies
  - Indigenous populations were for the most part demonized
  - The Olympics developed at the same time, helping a Greek identity to coalesce



## Summary 5: The Archaic Age: Sparta

- Archaic Crisis
  - Increasing travel, trade, and colonization brought challenges to the Greeks of the Archaic period
  - There is evidence for the emergence of many unfree groups: essentially serfs tied to the land
  - Competition, strife, and warfare between communities were characteristic of the Archaic period
  - These tensions were only exacerbated by the introduction of coinage and the emergence of a monetized economy
- Early Sparta
  - Sparta followed a unique course of development
  - Five villages federated, but Sparta always remained spatially decentralized
  - Some religious practices suggest a strong identification with Homer's heroes and heroines, but other cult spots, such as the throne of Apollo at Amyklai, were unique
  - The conquest of neighboring Messenia put Sparta on a different path
  - Full citizens were trained as full-time warriors, supported by the labor and produce of the enslaved helots
- The Great Rhetra
  - An account of the constitution, preserved in Plutarch centuries later, records details of the Spartan system of government
  - Ultimate power lay in the hands of the people. In an important amendment, the kings and council were given veto power
  - Spartan culture was vibrant in the Archaic period but gradually lost impetus
  - The transformation of Sparta lay in the increasing focus on warfare as a permanent state of affairs
  - Sparta's relations with the neighboring states of the Peloponnese also reflect an emphasis on regional hegemony



## Summary 6: The Archaic Age: Athens

- Competition and Rivalry
  - The early Athenian state was subject to a good deal of aristocratic rivalry and violence
  - There is also evidence for many social organizations that structured the life of the Athenians in tribes, brotherhoods, clans, and households
  - The adoption of coinage was viewed with suspicion by many who saw land and aristocratic values being replaced by the desire for wealth
  - Early Athenian law also points to a society still reliant on religious and family ties to underpin state institutions
- Solon
  - When civil unrest had almost reached the level of civil war in early Athens, Solon was appointed to resolve the continuing crisis
  - He focused on relieving the burden of debt afflicting share-croppers, and instituted a "shaking off" of burdens, the *Seisachtheia*
  - He also created a new, clear system of census classifications based on wealth in order to make political participation predictable and orderly
  - Across a range of fields, from funerary legislation to the law on tyranny, Solon's legislation represents a comprehensive attempt to put the Athenians state on a secure footing
- Peisistratos
  - In the short term Solon failed, and his time in office was followed by more faction fighting.
  - Out of these regional conflicts arose Peisistratos, who ruled Athens as tyrant throughout the middle of the sixth century
  - Despite tyranny's reputation, Peisistratos had a lasting positive influence on Athens, encouraging the development of a unified Athenian identity, prosperity and stability
  - After his death his sons continued to rule with the cooperation of other leading families but were seen as harsh and ruthless, resulting in assassination of Hipparchos and the exile of Hippias
- Kleisthenes
  - As regional violence threatened once again to engulf Athens a new leader emerged: Kleisthenes
  - He proposed a radical new political system, based on an entirely new organization of the state
  - The entire region of Attica, made up of 139 demes, was divided into ten new tribes
  - Each tribe was made of three thirds, each drawn from one of the regional districts of Attica
  - The result, building on Solon's reforms and Peisistratos's stability, was to give the Athenians a solid democratic foundation for their state
  - Kleisthenes disappears from history, but thanks to his and the earlier reforms of Solon and Peisistratos, the Athenians were in a position to survive the coming Persian invasions



## Summary 7: Persia

- Greece Prior to the Persian Wars
  - Greece was part of a zone of cultural interaction that stretched across the eastern Mediterranean and beyond
  - The Greeks labeled "barbarian" those whose speech they found difficult to understand
  - The phenomenon of "Othering," or emphasizing cultural difference, is a process that would sharply increase as a result of the Persian Wars
- Persia
  - Originally a semi-nomadic people of the steppes, the Persians entered the region of Iran before 700 BC
  - The same region had been home to various early cultures, making up a patchwork of peoples and kingdoms
  - The Persians came to dominate the region during the reign of Cyrus the Elder
    - His dynasty is called Achaemenid, named after the semi-mythical founder of the dynasty, Achaemenes
- The Achaemenids  
  - Cyrus and his successors fashioned a powerful empire
    - A religion focused on the Sky God, Ahura Mazda, provided unity and underpinned the dynasty
  - The empire depended on tribute from every region, and power was often given to local governors, called satraps
  - Persepolis served as the capital and symbolic center of this vast domain
  - Darius continued the territorial expansion of the Persian empire, crossing into Europe in 513 BC
  - A revolt of the Ionian Greeks in 499 BC brought the Persians into direct conflict with the Athenians
- Greece versus Persia
  - The Persians dispatched a force in 490 BC to punish the Athenians for having participated in the Ionian revolt
    - The Persians landed at Marathon but were defeated by the Athenian army
  - In the decade that followed Darius died and was succeeded by his son, Xerxes, who planned a much larger invasion by land and by sea.
  - Xerxes' army advanced slowly but the Greek response was hesitant and poorly coordinated
    - After the Greeks withdrew from Tempe in northern Greece in 480 BC, a smaller army, led by Leonidas of Sparta, fortified the position at Thermopylae to slow the Persian advance.
  - After the death of Leonidas, his 300 Spartans, and 700 Thespians, the Greeks still debated how and where to meet the Persians
  - Athens was evacuated and sacked
  - The Greek forces took to their ships and met the Persians at Salamis, where the Greeks were victorious
  - The Great King left Greece but his army only withdrew to Central Greece to winter quarters
  - The Persians came south again in 479 BC and were defeated at the Battle of Plataia
- Aftermath
  - The Greeks continued the war against Persia
  - Offerings of thanks for the Greek victory were dedicated at Delphi
  - In the decades to come, the triumph of the Greeks often resulted in an ugly triumphalism
  - The Persians were mocked as effeminate, and the cultural production of the Golden Age, whether on stage, in writing or visually, made frequent use of xenophobic stereotypes
    - Victory had come at a cost



## Summary 8: Democracy and Empire

- Introduction: From Ruin to Recovery
  - Immediately after the Persian Wars, the Greeks went on the offensive and undertook the expulsion of the Persians from the Aegean
  - The Athenians soon took over the Greek alliance from the Spartans and began a vigorous campaign throughout the Aegean
  - Although some episodes were designed to expel the Persians, many were thinly veiled attempts to secure control of the grain route from the Black Sea to Athens
  - Within no more than a decade, the Delian League had been transformed from a free alliance into an Athenian naval empire.
- Democratic Institutions
  - As the empire flourished abroad, so did democracy at home
  - The Ekklesia was open to all male adult citizens
  - The random selection of archons by lot replaced popular election, and payment for jury service also encouraged participation in democratic government
  - The Boulê, or Council of Five Hundred, administered affairs on a daily basis
    - Annual elections and the rotation of office meant that power was spread across a broad swathe of the citizen population
  - Many boards of magistrates also serving annually similarly helped avoid the aggregation of power in the hands of a narrow clique
  - The lawcourts were looked upon as the truest indication of the broad basis of Athenian democracy
    - Massed juries exercised the power of life and death
    - Oratory, as a consequence, was a highly prized skill
- The Imperial Democracy
  - Over the course of the 5th century BC the Athenians came to rely on the empire as a source of wealth, through tribute
  - The empire depended on an apparatus of government entirely supplied by the men of Athens as administrators, tax collectors, garrison commanders, soldiers, and sailors
  - The generation of Kimon saw Persia as the enemy, but Perikles saw the rift with Sparta as more pressing
  - From the middle of the fifth century, Athenian policy turned away from Persia and began to focus on conflict with Sparta and her allies
  - The Peace of Kallias likely represents an attempt by the Athenians to reach an understanding with the Persians in order to keep them out of the Aegean
- Colonies and Cleruchies
  - The Athenians used colonies to encourage the poor and the landless to leave Athens
  - Cleruchies functioned in the same way as Athenian colonies but allowed the settlers to remain Athenian citizens
    - This often relegated local populations to an inferior status
  - Even more irksome, according to Thucydides, was the system of tribute, by which the allies paid for their own servitude
  - Eventually the Athenians cancelled the entire system and replaced it with a flat 5% tax



## Summary 9: Inclusion and Exclusion: Life in Periklean Athens

- Drama
  - Greek drama probably grew out of the songs and dances accompanying rural festivals
  - Plots tended to be taken from well-known myth cycles, such as the Trojan War and the Seven Against Thebes Cycle
  - Robes and masks focused attention on the words and singing
  - Choruses often represented a kind of Everyman
  - Tragedies dealt with such deeply disturbing issues as incest and murder
    - Aristotle believed that watching such dramas provoked *katharsis*, or cleansing
  - Both tragedy and comedy were watched by the whole community
    - In effect they reinforced the democracy by providing a space for egalitarian performances
- The Akropolis
  - Under Perikles, the Akropolis was systematically and comprehensively rebuilt
    - It became the focal point for the expression of Athenian pride, both as a democratic state and an imperial power
  - The Parthenon replaced an older building on the south side of the Akropolis and was most likely paid for by the tribute received by the Athenians from the allies
  - The decoration of the Parthenon was revolutionary, depicting the Athenians performing the Panathenaic procession
  - The Propylaia and the Erechtheion also demonstrate the Periklean building program, designed to coordinate the many disparate cult sites of the Akropolis into one harmonious whole
    - Parts of the older buildings were still visible, offering tangible signs of the Akropolis's deep antiquity and sanctity
- Power and Exclusion
  - Athens was structured around twin poles of inclusion and exclusion
    - Foremost among those excluded from power and participation in civic life were Athenian women
  - Creation stories and early poetry reveal a deeply misogynistic vein in Athenian culture, also evident in sources of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, such as the works of Thucydides and Xenophon
  - Even a celebrated case, such as Lysias's speech on the Murder of Eratosthenes, reveals that a case of adultery was framed to an Athenian audience as principally a violation of the husband's rights
  - Sexual exploitation of women was common
  - Male sexuality also reflected uneven power dynamics
    - The Athenians practiced a form of pederasty that involved praising the beauty of boys and, if possible, seducing them
    - The difference between this and the exploitation of women was that boys were supposed to outgrow the role of *eromenos* on the way to becoming men
- Slavery
  - The most excluded members of Athenians society were slaves
  - From agricultural workers and miners to household slaves, the unfree provided the labor that made Greek culture possible
  - Slavery was omnipresent in Greek society and rarely questioned
  - A final excluded category are the metics, resident aliens who carried on much of Athens' commercial life and who rarely, if ever, were permitted citizenship



## Summary 10: Religion and Philosophy: Belief and Knowledge in the Classical Age

- Polis Religion
  - Religion and religious activities shaped the lives of the Greeks from birth to death
    - Coming of age for boys and girls was marked by religious ritual
  - The presence of sacrifice at every corner of social life shows that correct religious action played an enormous role in the lives of the Greeks
  - Recent discoveries of purification rites and sacred calendars remind us that the rhythm of daily life involved a continuous cycle of sacrificial and religious performances by the individual, by the local community, and by the state
- Conventional Belief
  - At the beginning of the 5th century BC, Athens in particular was a deeply conventional society in which the gods were seen as an active, integral part of daily life
  - Wearing very human faces, the gods of the Greeks were approachable and could be swayed, although the piety of the Greeks was deeply tinged by fear of the gods' power
  - To understand Greek religion it is valuable to keep in mind that it was not a religion of the book
    - No scripture dictated what a person must believe
    - Not only was the emphasis on action but it was also possible to recognize one's god in another's
    - Greek religion was not exclusive or proselytizing
- Splintering of Belief
  - The evolution of scientific medicine contributed a challenge to conventional thinking
    - Even as the cult of Asklepios was growing in popularity, so too the medical writing of Hippokrates and his students shows a new emphasis on empirical knowledge
  - The threat to conventional thinking also came from the Ionian philosophers of the 6th and 5th centuries BC, whose cosmological speculation had little place for the traditional gods
    - Instead they postulated a limitless universe, cosmic principles of elements in endless opposition, and a universe in constant flux
  - Some derided conventional views of the gods and castigated the venerable stories of Homer and Hesiod for making the gods as weak and venal as humans
  - The clash between new and old systems of thinking was commented on by contemporary commentators, such as Aristophanes
- Herodotos and Thucydides
  - The contrasting styles of Herodotos and Thucydides reveals the way that historiography mirrors the larger tensions and changes affecting the Greek world and Athens in particular
  - Though barely a generation apart, they employ very different methods
    - Herodotos relies on stories, dreams, oracles, and portents as if his writing were still influenced by Homer
      - He looks back to the world of the 6th century and earlier.
    - Thucydides writes in the manner of a pre-Socratic philosopher, banishing the gods from his account and instead trying to explain how warfare releases the worst human impulses
      - For him, the disease of a sick society can be analyzed in the same way as a Hippokratic doctor can read the symptoms of a sick body



## Summary 11: The Peloponnesian War

- Warfare and the Greeks
  - Warfare was a long-established staple of Greek life
    - Much early warfare consisted of border crossing and raiding
  - In the 6th century BC, hoplite warfare, conducted by heavily armed infantrymen in phalanx formation, emerged as the dominant mode of conflict
  - This development helped the emergence of democratic societies, in which men who fought side by side also served as fully enfranchised citizens
  - The establishment of democracy under Kleisthenes also saw the Athenian army adopt a high profile on the eve of the Persian Wars
  - Over the course of the 5th century BC the Athenians developed a formula for success: broad democracy, naval power, and imperial hegemony relied on and reinforced each other
- Causes of the Peloponnesian War
  - Sparta and Athens had followed divergent paths for some time
    - They spoke different dialects and exercised hegemony in different spheres
    - One was a conservative, inward-looking land power, the other a restless, outward-looking sea power
  - In the 430s a series of crises pushed the two states towards war
  - In 435 BC at Corcyra the Athenians intervened in a dispute between two Corinthian colonies: Epidamnos and Corcyra
    - In 433 BC at Potidaia the Athenians again provoked the Corinthians by laying siege to a Corinthian colony
  - The final straw was the Megarian Decree, an embargo on Megara imposed by the Athenians
  - All of these episodes represented an aggressive stance adopted by the Athenians, usually at the expense of Corinthian interests
- The Archidamian War
  - The first phase of the war lasted for a decade, during which the Spartans invaded each year
    - Following Perikles' policy, the Athenians relied on their walls for defense and brought supplies to the city by sea
  - Unexpectedly the city was devastated by a typhoid plague in the opening years of the war
    - Not only did this devastate Athens and demoralize the Athenians, it also took off Perikles
  - In the void left by the death of Perikles, Kleon emerged as the leading man
    - Violent and given to brinksmanship, he participated in two notable campaigns
    - He succeeded in capturing 420 Spartan hoplites on the island of Sphakteria but died in 422 BC at the battle of Amphipolis, along with the energetic Spartan general Brasidas
  - Both sides used these developments as an excuse to sign a peace treaty, the Peace of Nikias, in 421 BC
  - Peace did not last, but regional conflicts occupied the next campaigning seasons until the Athenians escalated the conflict
- The Sicilian Expedition
  - Between 415 and 413 BC the Athenians undertook a disastrous campaign in Sicily
    - Ostensibly undertaken to help the Athenian ally, Segesta, against the neighboring state of Selinous, in fact the campaign was an invasion designed to subdue Sicily and make it a part of Athens' empire
  - The campaign began in chaos, when statues of Hermes in Athens were desecrated on the eve of the fleet's departure
    - Shortly later, Alkibiades, a supporter of the expedition but implicated in the affair of the Hermes, jumped ship and defected to Sparta
  - For the next two seasons, the Athenians were led by Nikias, who proved to be a weak and vacillating commander
  - A great deal of the Athenian campaign consisted of building siege walls in an increasingly desperate attempt to capture Syracuse, the biggest and wealthiest Sicilian city
  - The campaign came to a climax in 413 BC during the Night Battle on the heights above Epipolai
    - Confused and demoralized, the Athenians were routed
  - In the weeks that followed the Athenian fleet was twice defeated
    - The remaining forces tried to flee by land but were cut off and captured
    - Nikias and Demosthenes were executed
- The Dekelean War
  - Despite the disaster in Sicily, the Athenians proved resilient
    - Even when an oligarchic coup saw the suspension of democracy in Athens, the fleet on Samos remained loyal to the spirit of the Athenian democracy
  - Following a defeat of the Spartans in 410 BC, democracy was restored in Athens and the city fought on
  - In the last phase of the war the Spartans built a permanent garrison on Athenian soil at Dekelea
  - The theater of war moved to the Hellespont, where Lysander attempted to choke off the Athenian grain supply
  - In 405 BC Lysander's fleet defeated the Athenians at the Battle of Aegospotamoi
  - The news reached Athens, and the Athenians faced the question of how they would be treated now that their empire was finished



## Summary 12: Panhellenism and the Rise of Philip

- Athens in Crisis
  - In the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, Lysander sailed into the port of Piraeus to take command of a defeated Athens
  - The Long Walls were dismantled
    - Most of the fleet was destroyed. Athens was reduced to dependence on Sparta
  - The Thirty, an oligarchy installed by Lysander, ruled oppressively and quickly became unpopular
  - Within a year a democratic resistance sprang up, eventually forcing the Thirty out and reinstating the democracy
- Sokrates
  - After the expulsion of the Thirty, the Athenians decided upon an amnesty
  - Nevertheless, the scars of the Thirty's reign ran deep and the period was one of anxiety
  - Although Sokrates had been regarded as something of a caricature earlier in his career, he was associated with the Thirty because he had been the teacher of Kritias, one of the leaders of the Thirty
  - His trial can be seen as a culmination of the religious anxieties and social tensions that had become more pronounced over the course of the Peloponnesian War
    - In other words, his trial served as the nearest thing to a political trial after the reign of the Thirty that could be conducted despite the amnesty that accompanied the restoration of democracy
- Spartan Hegemony
  - As victors, the Spartans enjoyed a new hegemony over many Greek states
  - Their rule was heavy-handed, involving the imposition of pro-Spartan oligarchies and garrisons
    - Their aggressions in Asia Minor prompted the Great King to subsidize a coalition against Sparta during the Corinthian War
    - This was followed by a Peace Treaty promulgated by the Great King to settle the war
  - The Athenian response was a cautious rebuilding of alliances, culminating in the Second Athenian Confederacy
  - Spartan authority remained heavy-handed in the Peloponnese, where they intervened in the internal affairs of neighboring states
  - The Sparta hegemony came to an end in 371 BC when they were comprehensively defeated by the Thebans at the Battle of Leuktra
  - The Theban hegemony lasted for less than ten years, but witnessed the founding of Messene in the land of the newly liberated Messenians, and Megalopolis in Arkadia
- Regionalism
  - Despite the continuing cycle of wars and successive hegemonies, the early 4th century BC is more than a repetition of earlier mistakes
  - A series of Common Peace Treaties, even if finally ineffectual, demonstrate that the Greek city-states were attempting to break the cycle of interstate violence
  - Leagues and federations, always a feature of Greek political and religious life, also became a notable feature of the political landscape
    - These regional groupings grew from a tendency to look for strength through aggregation
  - The final application of this principle was Panhellenism
    - Also a well-established feature of Greek life, in the fourth century bc Panhellenism took on fresh vitality as policy for unifying the Greeks
    - The 4th-century version of this, however, involved advocating a new Persian War
- Philip
  - Philip's career should be viewed against the backdrop of Macedonian history
    - Long marginalized, the Macedonians were looked down upon by the southern Greeks
  - His early career consisted on dynastic marriages and alliances designed to strengthen his control of Macedonia
  - His transformation of the Macedonian army saw the creation of a highly trained, professional, national army
  - He prosecuted plans for territorial expansion in every direction, coming into conflict with Athenian interests in the northern Aegean
  - By the mid-340s Philip had annexed territory as far south as Thermopylae
  - Once he had established the northern, western, and eastern borders of his expanded kingdom, he marched south
  - His victory at Chaironeia in 338 BC saw the end of the Classical order of independent Greek city-states and the beginning a new phase of Greek culture



## Summary 13: Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age

- Alexander's Early Reign
  - Alexander's reign began under a cloud
    - Philip had remarried in 337 BC, and a new heir would have been a threat to Alexander's position
    - When Philip was assassinated, Alexander moved quickly to annihilate any threats to his position
  - After quelling revolts in Greece, Alexander undertook the Asian campaign planned by his father
  - After an early victory at the Granikos, he began sweeping through Asia Minor
  - After a second victory, at Issos, he continued south through the Levant and all the way to Egypt
    - At Siwah he may have been greeted as the son of Zeus, a message he exploited propagandistically
- The Conquest of the East
  - At Gaugamela (in modern-day Iraq) Alexander conquered Darius III and in effect took his place
  - He continued marching further east in pursuit of the last Achaemenid king
    - After Darius was murdered by Bessos, Alexander pursued Bessos and executed him
  - Although the campaigns in the eastern satrapies are the stuff of romance and legend, Alexander's policy of founding cities points to a more serious purpose: annexing the nodes of an emerging trade route from China
  - The presence of Greeks in central Asia would not last long in terms of kingdoms and states, but the cultural fusion of Greek and Buddhist art from Gandhara points to the cross-fertilization of art and ideas
  - After turning south Alexander sought more provinces to conquer but after reaching northwestern India he was forced back after his men mutinied
  - He died in Babylon in 324 BC
- Ptolemaic Egypt
  - Alexander's generals carved a series of independent kingdoms from the carcass of Alexander's empire
    - The most successful of these was Ptolemaic Egypt
  - The Ptolemies inherited and refined a highly controlled state apparatus that oversaw a centralized economy
  - In Alexandria they sponsored a religious system that merged Greek and Egyptian cult practices, notably in the cult of Serapis
  - They presented themselves as pharaohs, adapting and adopting pharaonic practices, such as the continuing worship of the Apis bull
- Seleukids and Attalids
  - The Seleukids controlled much of the old Achaemenid realm, from Syria east to the edge of Iran
  - They too presented themselves as a renewal of an older dynasty, in this case the kings of Babylon
  - Seleukid history is often presented as 300 years of continuous decline, but they may have learned Alexander's lesson regarding control of the trade routes of central Asia
    - Controlling caravan routes and imposing taxes was a more profitable approach to empire than the control of vast swathes of territory
  - The Attalids controlled an even smaller domain, centered on Pergamon, but amassed great wealth
  - In common with the other dynasties, the Attalids craved legitimacy that they attempted to win by sumptuous acts of benefaction
    - Grain, money, and building were all given by the dynasties to key Greek cities and sanctuaries as ways of enhancing the dynasty's prestige
- Rome
  - Rome's involvement in the Greek world takes place after the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC
    - His failure, despite repeated successes, points to the astonishing reserves of manpower that Rome was capable of deploying in the field each year
  - Rome's move east was the result of many factors, not least of which was the impetus of each cohort of elite Romans to win glory in battle so as to amass wealth and political influence
  - Constantly responding to the threats of Hellenistic kings, successive waves of Roman armies fought further and further east after the defeat of Carthage in 202 BC
  - Rome's eastern entanglements had led to a change of policy by 146 BC
    - In the same year that Carthage was destroyed, so too was Corinth, while Macedonia was annexed as a Roman province
  - As Rome moved to absorb the Hellenistic east into the Roman imperium, more Greeks entered Rome, profoundly influencing the development of Roman culture
  - The melding of these cultures might have led to a true fusion, had Marc Antony and Cleopatra been victorious at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC
    - Instead Octavian was the victor and the entire Greek east was absorbed into the Roman empire
