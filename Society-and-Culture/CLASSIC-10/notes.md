## Lecture 1: Introduction

- Why Discover the Greeks? Three Proposals
  - In discovering the Greeks, the Greeks discover us
    - We are accustomed to seeing Greek influence all around us
      - Greek life
      - Mathematics
      - Our language
        - Syllabus comes from the Greek word sittuba ("label")
        - Idea comes from idein ("to see")
        - Biology comes from bios ("life") + logos ("study")
        - Pharmacy comes from pharmakon ("potions"/"drugs")
        - Democracy means "the people's power"
        - Zoe means "life"
        - Sophia means "wisdom"
        - etc.
      - Architecture
        - Washington D.C.
    - Discovery leads to self-reflection => the Greeks discovering us
    - We discover the Greeks asking questions, and in turn the Greeks discover us in the midst of our own questions
      - What is justice, and who determines it? (see *Iliad*)
      - What is the meaning of home? Is there such thing as a noble lie? (see *Odyssey*)
      - What is beauty, and is it merely a nicety or is it *essential* to life? (see Minoan and Mycenaean art)
      - What is the purpose of education (see Aristophances' *Clouds*)
      - What defines citizenship? Who gets to be a citizen (see Sophocles' *Antigone*)
      - What defines a nation or people? (see Herodotus' *Histories*)
      - Does religion make us sane or crazy? (see Euripides' *Bacchae*)
      - What is the good life? (see Plato's *Apology*, or really any of the course's texts)
    - A philosophy of buildings - Mausolus and Diogenes
  - No one has ever discovered the Greeks the way *you* will
    - Individual perspectives lead to individual conclusions
    - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
  - The Greeks are curious
    - For all the ways in which the Greeks are similar to us, there are many ways in which they are different
    - Polypragmon
      - Poly ("much"/"many") + pragma ("matter"/"thing"/"issue")
      - The Greeks are interested in many matters
      - Super busy
      - "Restless" (applied by comic playwrights to the Athenians)
      - "All up in your business" (applied to Socrates)
      - "Overly curious" (applied to Herodotus)
- Pragmatics
  - BCE and CE = BC and AD
  - Hellenic/Hellas = Greek/Greece
  - One challenge of evidence: often not contemporaneous (ex: Homer writing poems around 800 - 700 BCE, but referring to events that happened around 500 years prior)
    - Text originates from one time, but talk about another
  - Perspective of the evidence (elite, male, not only reflective of the world, but actively shaping it)
  - Spelling



## Lecture 2: The Big Bang: The Case of the Minoans

- The Greeks before "The Greeks"
  - Neolithic Greece (7000 - 3000 BCE)
  - Bronze Age (3000 - 1200 BCE)
    - Focus today on Minoans
    - Wednesday on Mycenaeans
- A fundamental fact: there is much that we don't know
- Greece "before the Greeks"
  - The nature of the evidence: mostly non-textual
  - How might we "read" that evidence?
  - When we read Homer this week and next, how should we relate Homeric poetry to the societies of Bronze Age Greece?

- Big Questions in Background
  - What are the roles of beauty (decorative objects, paintings, etc.) in Bronze Age (i.e. Minoan and Mycenaean) culture?
    - What did they think about them?
    - Are we projecting what we think about them?
  - How might we speculate about the societal structure of Bronze Age societies? Consider ideas of hierarchy, redistributive economy, and possibly gender roles
  - What functions does religion seem to have?
    - What does it imply about how groups of people thought about their place in the world?
- Neolithic Greece (c. 7000 - 3000 BCE)
  - Stone tools, pre-smelting
  - We start to see oats, wild barley, etc. in the agricultural record
  - Fish bones in caves tells us people were eating fish => shows degree of sophistication
  - Towards the latter half of the era:
    - Mud huts
    - Domestication of crops
    - Introduction of pottery => movement beyond stone tools to the manipulation of earth into vessels used for various purposes
      - Terracotta figurine of woman => purpose unknown
      - Polychrome (multi-colored) vase => shows deliberate use of time to decorate vessel, object no longer strictly utilitarian
  - Dimini (c. 4800 - 4500 BCE)
    - What is the purpose of the set of concentric walls that surround the site?
      - Were they for defensive purposes?
      - Were they used for retaining the earth?
        - Were they both?
    - The presence of a **megaron** (a large central building) that isn't easily accessible
      - To what extent does this central space indicate the presence of a central authority of some kind?
      - View the way architecture can imply social organization
- The Bronze Age (c. 3000 - 1200 BCE)
  - Widespread adoption of bronze metallurgy (alloy of copper and tin, and sometimes other metals)
    - Something more complex than the tools from the Neolithic Age, signifies technological advancement
  - Circulation of goods and people throughout the Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean
    - Port-to-port trading (cabotage)
    - Places have become more settled
    - Things end up in a site far away from where they were produced (movement of people)
      - Things acquire value by being far away from their source
  - Cycladic Figurine from Cycladic Islands (2600 - 2400 BCE)
    - Made of marble
    - Usually found in burial sites
      - Hundreds of thousands of occurrances
    - Hard to interpret
      - Idol? Representation of someone offering themselves to the gods? Human? Deity? Meant to show beauty?
- The "Minoans"
  -  Minoan Culture (1900 - 1450 BCE)
    - One of 2 major Bronze Age cultures of Ancient Greece (the other being the Mycenaeans)
    - Primary site of inhabitation: the island of Crete
      - Settlements at Knossos and Thera
      - Away from the central power of Greece on the mainland
  - Aesthetics
    - Why did they make the objects they made?
  - Mystery
    - Things we can't know from inference
  - Myth
    - The Minotaur and the Labyrinth
    - King Minos is brought up by Thucydides in antiquity (5th century BCE)
      - In reference to his vast naval power (thalassocracy)
  - Knossos
    - Much of what we know about Knossos is shaped by Sir Arthur Evans
      - Archaeologist determined to prove the existence of King Minos and the Minotaur
      - Includes name of the Minoans themselves
      - Not all of this information is historically accurate
    - The Labyrinth is possibly the palace at Knossos
      - Extremely complex floor layout => winding maze
      - Exaggeration of the megarons from Neolithic Greece
      - Architecture suggestive of centralized power
    - The Palace at Knossos
      - May not be a home as we understand it
      - Other sites lead us to believe palaces were used as religious/economic centers
    - Bull-Leaping
      - Ritual holds a high significance in Minoan culture
      - Bull-leaping signet ring is speculated to show a religious story of the movement of the stars
      - Bull's Head Rhyton
        - Used as a libations rhyton, then destroyed
      - Leads to question of what did the Minoans think of what it meant to live a good life?
  - Linear A
    - System of writing used by Minoans
    - Cannot be translated
      - What has been translated is not particularly interesting - mostly logs
  - Linear B
    - Has been translated, complex relation to Linear A
  - Redistributive Economy
    - Surplus of staple goods used to support non-essential workers and farmers in the event food was scarce
      - A balancing act
      - People in charge of maintaining a surplus and people in charge of creating the surplus
      - Attempt at societal organization
    - Pithoi - large storage vessels
  - Less Elite Sites
    - Building I-O-N at Vronda
      - Humble houses
      - Signs of cookware, animal slaughter, etc.
      - Perhaps more representative of common folk
      - Expansion indicative of multiple generations
  - Akrotiri, Thera
    - Cosmopolitan harbor city filled with frescoes
      - Were these religious? Celebration of wealth? Celebration of accomplishment?
      - Saffron Gatherer
      - Fisherman Fresco
      - Flotilla Fresco
      - West House Fresco
        - Earliest representation of the story of Troy?
    - Destroyed by eruption of a volcano
- The Big Bang: What Destroyed Minoan Culture?
  - Myth helpful? Destruction of Atlantis
  - The problems of 1628 BCE and 1450 BCE
    - Marine style pottery post-dates volcanic eruption at Akrotiri
    - Minoans likely weren't destroyed immediately by the volcano at Akrotiri
  - Safest conclusion: destruction of Thera disrupted trade networks and likely hurt agriculture elsewhere, but other Minoan sites persist until 1450 BCE
- Tentative Conclusions about Minoans
  - Architecture implies some kind of centralized authority and possibly a redistributive economy
    - Are the heroes of the *Iliad* representative of authority figures?
  - Frescoes especially suggest an attention to aesthetics (but to what end?)
    - Man vs. Monkey is an example of a reminder that we can mistakenly project meaning onto the Minoans
  - Religious objects and space indicate awareness of the fragility of life?
    - Destruction of Thera in 1628 and other sites around 1450 BCE
    - Things wouldn't always endure



## Lecture 3: The Mycenaeans

- Two Bronze Age societies
  - The Minoans (1700 - 1450 BCE)
    - Knossos
    - Akrotiri on Thera
  - The Mycenaeans (1500-1100 BCE)
    - Mycenae
    - Troy
    - Knossos
- The Mycenaeans: Three Things to Explore
  - Conspicuous power (esp. expressed architecturally and in material remains)
  - Bellicosity (in material remains and in likely takeover of Minoan sites)
  - Homeric connections
- Heinrich Schliemann (1822 - 1890)
  - Schliemann is responsible for much of what we know about the Mycenaeans
  - Determined to prove Homer, Agamemnon, etc. were real
  - Can be credited with discovering what we now believe is Troy and the unearthing of Mycenae
    - Was also a falsifier/exaggerator/liar, so take his discoveries with a grain of salt
- The Fortress Site of Mycenae
  - Highly indicative of wealth, conveying a sense of power and formidability
    - Cyclopean walls
    - Heroic burials
    - Massive tombs
  - City of Agamemnon
  - Lion's Gate, Grave Circles, Treasury of Atreus, etc.
  - Goods from Grave Circle A
    - Lion Fight Dagger, Gold Death Mask
    - Gold shows high reverence for those they buried
    - Absence of mineral-rich terrain nearby indicates a large web of connections with other civilizations
- What about ordinary lives?
  - Doeroi/doerai - slaves
    - Perfume manufacturing workers
    - Textile workers
  - Bronzesmiths, bow-makers, chariot-builders, shepherds
    - Mentioned in tablets
  - People who carded wool and weaved flax for ships' sails
  - People who grew and harvested beets, sesame, fennel, mint, celery, etc.
  - Geronsia (council) and damos (group of landholders)
    - Gerousia (council of elders in Sparta)
    - "Demos" (people)
- Mycenaean Takeover of Knossos (c. 1450 BCE)
  - The "smoking gun" - the replacement of Linear A (Cretan) by Linear B (early Greek) at Minoan sites
    - Results in the conclusion that the Mycenaeans took over the Minoan sites
  - Story of King Minos and the Minotaur and Theseus slaying the Minotaur may act as a myth in reference to the Mycenaean takeover of the Minoans
    - Perversion of the Minoans' reverence for bulls
- Linear B
  - Discovered to be inflective
  - Some translations resemble Greek
  - Lack of literature, literature remained oral
    - Written information were records, tax info, etc.
  - Linear A and Linear B are both syllabaries
    - Linear A
      - Minoans
      - Untranslated
    - Linear B
      - Mycenaeans
      - Translated
      - Form of Greek
      - Presence at Minoan sites indicates Mycenaean takeover at those site
- The "Evidence" from Homer
  - Reading the *Iliad*
    - Focus on the main issues in each book: conflict and consequences (Book 1); the death of Patroclus and the description of Achilles' shield (Book 18); and the destruction of Troy and the human consequences esp. Andromache's lament (Book 22)
    - Pay attention to its aesthetics (similes, descriptive epithets for characters): why are these there and how do they generate sympathy and enhance the reading experience?
    - What does it mean that a culture's first great work of literature focuses on the pain, rage, pathos, of an individual?



## Lecture 4: Homer + the Mycenaeans: Facts and Fictions 

- Pylos and Troy
  - The "Palace at Pylos"
    - Opulent
    - Tons of Linear B palace providing administrative information
    - The Palace of Nestor
    - Built atop an acropolis
      - Acropolis - high point of a city
- Minoans and Mycenaeans
  - After the Mycenaean takeover, we see the circulation of Minoan goods back to the Mycenaean mainland
    - Is this just pure conquest or is there an admiration for the conquered society?
- Homer
  - A lot of the sense of recalling something grander
    - "The past is better"
  - Conclusions about Homeric Pylos
    - There are some apparent correspondences between Homer's descriptions of such things as "Nestor's Palace" and the court-complex at Pylos
      - Earth-shaker
      - Capacity for long-term storage
      - Cups made of gold
      - Many benches
    - Terminology for palace rule is inconsistent or vague in Homer (who's in charge, the wanax or the basileus?)
- Was the Trojan War real?
  - In antiquity, Greeks were thinking about the history of the Trojan War
    - Whether or not it happened seems to have mattered to their identity
    - Thucydides relates its existence to Greek Unity
  - Questioning the Myth
    - Agamemnon cited as having gained leadership in the war since he was the preeminently powerful man in Greece at the time (wealth of Mycenae)
      - Relied on fear to assemble his expedition, not goodwill
    - Hero Shrine of Menelaus and Helen
      - Idea in the *Iliad* that Helen was hated by the Greeks
      - A shrine in Lakonia with evidence that Helen was continually worshipped
        - Archaeological evidence contradicts myth
    - There is a layer of Troy that seems to have been destroyed by siege
      - Fits the right timeline
      - The preceding layer of Troy had evidence of Mycenaean pottery
  - Hittite Correspondence (c. 1300 - 1200 BCE)
    - Diplomatic letters mention "Wilusa" (Ilion == Troy?)
    - Piyamaradu ~ Priam?
    - Alaksandu ~ Alexandros == Paris?
- Homeric Version of Events
  - Not written down until after 750 BCE
  - Oral formulaic poetry (to be explained Monday)
  - Different versions of the poems based on difference performances
  - Potential differences between the "poet's time" (which change over centuries) and the "poem's time"
  - Complicated by the inherent nostalgia of the poems
  - Homer as a hybrid
    - Ex: chariots driven into battle, followed by fighting hand-to-hand => Bronze Age vs. Iron Age tech
- Homeric Facts and Fictions about the Bronze Age
  - Yes, Homeric poems make reference to elements of the Bronze Age world
  - But Homer's poems represent a tradition that accrued over many decades and centuries
    - They thus also exhibit elements from a later age, such as:
      - Iron weapons
      - Funeral pyres
      - Fighting as a mobile infantry
    - Show aspects of Homer's time, the past, and the even later past
- The End of the Mycenaean World (c. 1200 - 1100 BCE)
  - Why?
  - Dispersal of peoples, palaces occupied by squatters and shepherds, etc.
  - Slave revolt? Climate changes? Siege?
  - Best answer: the Sea People
    - People that exploited the weakness of various Mycenaean sites?
      - Wall-less Pylos
    - Their presence attests to the massive upheavals in the Mediterranean
  - Nostalgia of Homer's poems and tendency to magnify the past come from the fact that they were written in a downturn of Greece



## Lecture 5: Homer as the Internet

- Homer
  - Even in antiquity, Homer's literature was highly valued
  - There is an air of mystery surrounding Homer
  - Much like the Internet today, Homer was the prevalent resource for learning about living, virtue, etc. in antiquity
    - Sense of Homer having total knowledge
    - Links different people across time and space, giving them a collective idea of their past
    - Was "editable" - the storyteller could modify his stories to adjust for the locale/audience
  - An oral phenomenon originally
  - Some facts?
    - The epic poems called the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* are long narrative poems, sung in verse or chanted, often before an audience
    - Oral poems: for performance, for recitation, more than reading
    - Composition of the poems as we have them now is usually dated to the mid to late 8th century or early 7th century
      - About 400 years of recitation before the stories were written down
    - Homer was likely the poet/the name of the editor who recorded the oral tradition and crafted two poems out of that tradition
      - Not mutually exclusive
      - Some claim Homer is the name of the oral tradition as a whole
- Oral Composition and Authorship
  - Milman Parry
    - Made comprehensive notes on the building blocks of oral composition
      - These building blocks are vehicles of memory
      - Related these observations to Homeric tradition
    - Substitution of descriptions were made in stories, keeping the main story the same
  - Albert Lord
- Homeric "Coding"
  - Poetic meter: dactylic hexameter as "code"
    - Long short short - `^ ^` (dactyl)
    - Long long - `-` (spondee)
    - Hard to get to work in English
    - Based on the quantity of the vowel
  - Epithets as Coding/Building Blocks
    - "Resourceful Odysseus"
    - "Helen of the lovely hair"
    - What is the purpose of these formulae?
      - Gives the orator the ability to stitch things together in meter
- Glances into the Power of Homer
  - Achilles' Great Speech
    - Philosophizes about war, those who have nothing vs. those who have much
    - Compares himself to a mother bird, creating contrast between the act of war and the beauty of nature
    - The paradox of the heroic life
      - Desire for the hero to return home involves failing to die in battle and memorializing your name
  - The Gods
  - The Human Cost
    - Andromache's Lament
- *Odyssey*
  - Tells the story of Odysseus' ten-year homecoming after ten years of war
  - Focus on the household with special attention to his son and wife
  - Also on Odysseus' suffering adventures
  - Odysseus' Mortal Choice
    - A moment where he has to choose what kind of life he wants
      - Calypso's island
    - Offered the chance to become immortal, but he chooses to return home
  - Penelope's Subjectivity
    - A secret shared between Odysseus and Penelope
    - Penelope's perspective
- Homer's Hold on Us
  - Emotional vividness
  - Grandeur in language ("wine-blue water", "teeth's barrier") and plotting (think of the many books of delay in Odysseus' arrival)
  - Also the tiny details: "her heart pondering much," or Andromache's thoughts on her orphaned son
  - Sheer vitality, across many centuries



## Lecture 6: The Iron Age

- Chronology
  - Bronze Age (Minoans and Mycenaeans) = 2000 - 1100 BCE
  - Iron Age = 1100 - 700 BCE
  - Iron Age, sometimes called the Dark Age or Geometric Period
- Lefkandi
  - Based in a large settlement from about 950 BCE
    - People that lived here, and their houses, were buried under this structure
    - Are the burials the burial sites of some heroic/ruler figure? 
  - Indications of trade with other locations
    - Bronze amphora
  - Indications of wealth
    - Large amounts of gold, manufactured centuries before the burial
    - Indicates high social status of the buried
  - Contrary to the fall of palatial structures, other settlements like Lefkandi continued to operate
- Revising the Dark Ages
  - Centaur figurine broken into 2 pieces and thrown into 2 graves
    - Beyond utilitarian
    - Suggested to be representative of Chiron
  - Pithos depicting the Trojan Horse
    - Evidence of continuity over the centuries, despite the decline of other aspects of civilization
  - Shows that cultural phenomena did persist => is the Dark Age really dark?
- Decline? It Depends on Where You Dig
  - Inhabitants of east-central Greece didn't experience as much decline as those further south
  - Calls into question why scholars were so quick to dub this period as a period of decline
- Evidence of Continuity
  - Hero cults (cultural memory)
    - People from the distant Bronze Age era continued to be honored by people during the Iron Age
  - Homeric poems
    - Being recited at festivals, ceremonies, get-togethers, etc.
  - Ancient tombs preserved
    - Tholos tomb, Attica, c. 1400 BCE
    - Dromos shows pottery from Iron Age to Classical Period
  - "Nestor's Cup" c. 725 BCE
    - Found in Bay of Naples (far west side of the Italian Peninsula)
      - Informative of Greek movement at this time
    - Some of the earliest evidence of a new Greek alphabet, after the disappearance of Linear B
- Phoenician Signary and Greek Alphabet
  - Greeks took over the Phoenician system and applied it to Greek sounds
    - Possibly for trade standardization purposes?
  - da, de, di, do, du
    - In Linear B, each of the above would have been a different symbol
    - In Phoenician one symbol or letter stood for all
    - Greek letter delta represents only the sound that those syllables have in common
    - Greek adds written vowels
- Other Evidence against the Dark Age?
  - Dipylon Amphora (765 - 730 BCE Athens)
    - More evidence of cultural productivity during the Dark Age
    - Mass produced in a workshop
    - Mark a grave and display burial activity
- The oikos
  - Roughly means household
  - A patrilineal family unit, including servants, retainers, slaves, etc.
  - Represented in the *Odyssey*
  - Think of Lefkandi as being the home of a particular oikos
  - The lowly thete
    - A person unattached to an oikos and/or owning no land
    - Have no personal security
    - Immigrants, refugees, escaped slaves, etc.
    - Mentioned in Achilles' dialogue in the *Odyssey*
- Early Law from Dreros, Crete
  - Regardless of the lack of literature present from the period, it's significant that law has been written
  - Much of early Greek law is procedural, rather than theoretical
  - The written nature of the law curbs arbitrariness for the people in antiquity
- Units of Identity in Migration from Metropolis
  - Ethne - people who asserted a common ethnic identity
  - Koinon - political federations
  - Oikoi - households, including slaves
  - Kleros - a plot of land
    - Give people an incentive to get them to relocate
  - Agora - marketplace
  - Polis - city-state or city
  - Idea that the Greeks mythologize their encounters with others, vilifying the "other" and highlighting their conquests
    - Evident in their artwork
-  Institution of the Olympics
  - Supposedly started by Heracles
  - Actual occurrence that creates Greek unity
  - Promotion of Greekness/Panhellism
  - Acts as a religious festival - it was a sacred event
  - Participation in the Olympics is how you won glory and undying fame
  - Pindar (6th - 5th century BCE)
    - Odes to the glorious athletes
    - Writes on the vulnerability of success and how victory is fleeting



## Lecture 7: The (Strange?) Case of Sparta

- Archaic Age or Period: Roughly 750/700 - 480 BCE
  - Bronze Age => Iron Age => Archaic Age => Classical Age
  - A period of tension (stasis) internally within the society
    - Two axes:
      - Vertical between the elite and those with less power
      - Horizontal between aristocratic families
  - How does Sparta choose to iron out these tensions in the way their constitution is composed?
- Sparta, in Lakonia, on the Peloponnesus
  - Also think about the other dependent territories neighboring Sparta
  - Geographically isolated
    - How did this alter Sparta's course compared to a city like Athens?
  - Laconic - short of speech
    - In antiquity, Spartans were not typically thought of as masterful orators
  - Place of seemingly restrained wealth and aesthetic
- "The Spartan Mirage": Seeing what one wants to see
  - Sources for Sparta include:
    - Herodotus (c. 430 BCE)
    - Thucydides (end of the 400s BCE)
    - Xenophon (b. Athens c. 430 BCE)
      - The Spartan Constitution
    - Plutarch (46 - 126 CE)
      - Biographer and ethical philosopher, not historian
      - Lives include that of Lykourgos
  - Contemporary references to Sparta as a way to use their legacy for their purposes
  - The mirage is an old fashioned phenomenon
    - Lykourgos leaving the example of Sparta as a city as his legacy
    - How much is accurate and how much is legend?
    - Poetry enforcing their military ideology
- Spartan Domination
  - Helots - serfs or slaves of the Spartan state, including the subjugated peoples of Messenia
    - Primarily agricultural slaves
    - Forced to wear clothes to identify their class
    - Forced to humiliate themselves
    - Establishes a huge chasm of inequality between them and the elite Spartan males
    - Outnumbered Spartans 7:1
    - Thought to not be under direct, personal control, just under their range of dominion
  - Helot existence likely shaped Spartan life
    - Threat of rebellion
    - Many attempts by the helots to force their way out of the Spartan subjugation
  - Perioeci (people who lived around Sparta) served in the Spartan army
- What (Else) Makes Sparta Unique
  - Treatment of children and male youths ("Ephebes")
    - Children taken from their families and grow up with other young boys
    - System of military training called agoge
  - Syssitia (mess-hall groups; dining groups)
    - Imposed to promote solidarity/military brotherhood
  - War itself brought a respite to training for war
- Spartiate Homoioi ("equals") + Others
  - Brotherly training + militaristic life meant to promote equality between the elite
    - Allowed to abuse and demean other homoioi if you felt it helped keep them in line
    - Women essential in this process
  - Hypomeiones (inferiors)
    - Failed to meet the military ideal, physically weak, etc.
  - Krypteia - a spy system by which Spartans attempted to control helots by having young Spartan men spying on helots, who could murder them if caught
- Xenelasia
  - Annual expulsion of foreigners
  - Shows Spartan distrust of outside influence
- Spartan Government and Eunomia
  - Spartan government: misotyrannos?
    - Tyrant-hating
    - Mixed-constitution => elements of oligarchy, democracy
    - Dual kingship (basileis)
      - One is a check on the other
      - Insurance policy for wartime
      - Kings also chief priests, an important role for a society valuing public sacrifice
    - Gerousia - council of elders
      - 28 men over the age of 60 who serve the rest of their lives
      - Kings were a part of the Gerousia
      - Wealthy men who were elected
      - Voted by voice
      - Court for high crime
    - Ephors - judicial overseers/magistrates; inspectors of youth
      - 5 of these elected annually
      - Over the age of 30
      - King's supervisors
      - Could impeach and dethrone kings if reason called for it
      - Self-audited by successive ephors
    - Assembly - ekklesia
      - All male citizens over the age of 30
      - ~95% of people in Sparta were not citizens (helots, perioeci, women, etc.)
- Women in Sparta
  - Women were often part of the exercise routine of Spartans 
  - Notorious for boldness and outspokenness
    - Not quite correct to see them as entirely liberate
  - Often separated from their husbands => allowed polyandry
    - Resolves potential dispute of inheritance, shrinking the lines of descent
  - No obligation to engage in moneymaking/domestic work
  - Aristotle complains 40% of land was controlled by women => had property rights
  - Plutarch's *Sayings in Spartan Women*
    - Women fully in line with Spartan military ethos
    - Criticism/praise of the homoioi
  - Alkman (late 7th, early 6th century BCE)
    - Lyric poet
    - Partheneion - "maiden-song"
    - Wrote poetry performed publicly, praising women
- Spartan Culture
  - Vix Krater found in Celtic France => reinforces the sense of Spartan intimidation/strength
  - Lot of negative/repressive/harsh aspects, in contrast with beauty
  - Always existing as a foil to Athens



## Lecture 8: Game of Thrones: Archaic Athens

- Foundation Myths: Theseus and Autochthony
  - Region: Attika/Attica
  - asty = urban area
  - Polis = total city-state, including surrounding agricultural and pastoral land; "The Athenians"
- Archaic Government at Athens (8th - end of 6th century)
  - Always aristocratic people in these roles
  - Archons (ruler/someone in charge):
    - Archon basileus - cults and religious matters, including sacred property
    - Polemarch - commander of the Attic army
    - Eponymous Archon - leading executive office ("archonship of so-and-so")
      - ~ President
      - Early 7th century => total of 9 archons
      - 9 Archons (including 6 judicial archons) all elected to 10-year terms by "people of good ancestry" (Eupatrids); system in place until 508 BCE
    - Council of the Areopagus ("hill of Ares"), composed of former archons
      - Some sort of advisory function to the assembly?
  - Assembly (ekklesia) - male citizens; functions of assembly obscure
    - ~ House of Representatives
    - Various divisions and/or factions:
      - Phylae (tribes) - related groups of families working together
      - Phratries (brotherhoods) - groups forming together from smaller micro-units
      - Gene (p. genos) - "Clan", a potentially dynastic structure
  - Athens, similar to Sparta, had somewhat "mixed" or distributed forms of power in the Archaic Age
  - The people who tended to fill those positions were the wealthy aristocrats
  - In-fighting between aristocrats became a source of political instability; elite groups or family clans (gene) in Athens experience and produce much political tension
- Wealth != Virtue
  - Money doesn't imply the existence of anything we might call virtuous
  - Idea present in Archaic poetry
- Instability in Athens: an Example
  - Kylon's Failed Coup (632 BCE)
    - Kylon attempts to become tyrant
    - Megakles (Archon) - member of Alkmaionid family kills Kylon's supporters
    - Alkmaionids now under a curse or "polluted" because of murder of Kylon's supporters, who had taken refuge by tying themselves to the statue of Athena
  - Game of Confusion: Brief Story of the Alkmaionids (Family of Accursed Megakles)
    - Kleisthenes of Sikyon and his daughter Agariste
      - Hippokleides, son of Tisander
      - Megakles II son of Alkmaion, Grandson of Aforementioned Megkles
        - Megakles II + Agariste => ... => Pericles
  - Aristocratic families (aristoi) jockeying for power
    - Don't go away, power gradually tempered
  - Meanwhile, tensions between the moneyed/powerful and the poor/indebted/powerless increase
  - Solon elected as eponymous archon to make reforms
    - These reforms address debt-bondage, but do not fix things overnight
      - People are unable to pay their debts and forced into a terrible state of living
    - Solon's reforms should be seen as paving the way/laying the groundwork for future reforms that move Athens towards a kind of democracy
- Solon as Moderate in his Poetry and Politics
- Solon's Reforms => Moderating the Strife
  - Seisachtheia - "The shaking off of burdens": a cancelling of debts
    - Hektemoroi ("sixth-porters") - poor sharecroppers; system ended
    - Debt slaves - no longer possible to pauy debt through property or person
  - Classes based on agricultural wealth
    - Pentakosiomedimnoi
    - Hippeis
      - These can become an archon
    - Zeugitai
    - Thetes
      - These can attend the assembly
  - Citizenship for foreign craftsmen (contrast with Sparta)
  - Amnesty for exiles and former attempted tyrants
    - New punishment for would-be tyrants => atimos (socially/politically ruined)
  - Property dispersal to anyone a male wished (for the childless)
  - Domestic and sumptuary (expenditure) reforms: check your status
    - Prothesis (laying out of body) must be indoors
    - Ekphora (procession of corpse) before sunrise
    - Only older women could participate
    - No more than 3 cloaks per women
    - Food and drink in procession could not be costly
      - Meant to allieviate class tensions caused by flaunting of wealth
    - Fathers couldn't sell children into slavery
      - Unless unmarried daughter was found to not be a virgin
  - Laws on axones (tablets) placed in middle of Athens in agora
- Solon Visits King Croesus of Lydia (Herodotus 1.29-33)
- Tyrants are Not Always So "Tyrannical"
  - Elections annually
  - Rural magistrates
  - Loans to the poor at low interest
  - Expanded silver mining at Laureion
  - Horos inscriptions marking off the agora
  - The Dionysia and Panathenaia
    - Latter open to all Athenians, regardless of regional identity
    - Honoring Athena with a new robe
    - Music festivals, athletic contests, etc.
      - Civic identity
- Forgetting the Tyrants on Purpose
  - Athenians want to forget they were ever ruled by those who had seized power



## Lecture 9: “Let’s Get This Party Started”: The Symposium

- Reminder: Mini-Essay #1
  - Due Fri. 10/22 at 11:59pm
  - Exhibit an informed reaction either to an image from Greek material culture or to a select chunk of primary reading
  - 500 words max., double-spaced
    - If passage, print it at the top of your paper
  - Favor analysis over summary
- Picking up on points from last time
  - Solon's reforms moderate, but obviously don't resolve class tensions
  - Period of rule by the Peisistratids demonstrates the extent to which the term "tyranny" doesn't always connote negativity
    - Better to think of tyrants as "rulers" who seize power, but could exercise it for good or bad
    - Archon lists indicate that there were still archons (often friends of the tyrants)
  - Later attempts to "erase" evidence of tyrant rule at Athens part of Athenian self-mythologization as founders of democracy
  - If tyrants weren't so bad, why erase their history?
    - There were repressive, abusive tyrants in Greece, and thus just having been ruled by anyone with that title sounds bad
    - Fundamentally, even if a tyrant worked for the common good, they still held power by force/trickery and seized it without the consent of the governed
    - If you're Athenian, and rule by tyranny ends by Spartan intervention, it feels better to contribute everything to the work of Athenians
- The End of Tyrants in Athens: The Story of Aristogeiton and Harmodios
  - TLDR: Spartans ended the tyranny in Athens
- Remembering the "Tyrant Slayers"
  - Issue of class? Aristogeiton as a figure with whom many citizens, especially not of the upper class, could identify
  - Narrative that will become dominant in the drinking song converts the lovers' privately motivated act into a public-spirited moment of rebellion, benefitting future generations
- Kleisthenes' Reforms
  - Ten new tribes (phylae) to replace old tribes:
    - Each tribe subdivided into trittyes, or thirds, composed of clustered "demes" (villages and townships), which each "third" coming from one geographic region (city, shore, and inland)
  - So, to make a tribe, take one trittys from each geographical region and put three together
    - Creating civic identities that are not based on location
  - Some Effects
    - Weakens "voting-blocks" and local deme loyalties; switches loyalty to wider "tribe"
    - Also means that it doesn't matter as much if you're from a poor area of Attica/poor area with bad crops: you are linked through your phyle to people from other geographical regions
    - Participation in your tribe in the army as well as religious activity creates sense of unity across Attica
  - De-concentrated power from the aristocratic class
  - Council (Boule) of the Five Hundred
    - Fifty members per tribe chosen by lottery
    - Drew up legislation for Assembly (ekklesia) to vote on
    - Each tribe in charge for 1/10 of year
  - Ostracism
    - Expulsion of a public figure for 10 years
    - Ostraka (broken pottery sherd)
      - Way of checking power on potentially power-hungry individuals
      - Ostracism was a rare event; interval between votes
      - Retain property, etc.
- Question of How to Develop Democracy
  - "Can democracy be engineered by an elaborate set of institutions, or does it depend on a deeper, more fundamental commitment to such principals as equality and the rule of law?"
- From Public to Private? The Symposium
  - Drinking, singing hymns, singing poems, philosophical discussion, etc.
  - Traditionally a men's activity
    - Women there for music, sex, etc.
  - Meant to have established a feeling of equality
  - Drinking from kylix (drinking cup)
    - Often depict scenes from a symposium
    - Meta-reflective traits => suggestive that the event is a time of self-reflection
    - Idea that the symposium is where you are being proved in the company of your peers
  - Interpret the robust nature of the symposium as an event for aristocratic bonding in the face of the changing political environment



## Lecture 10: Statues and Songs 

- Looking to the End
  - King Croesus and Solon
  - Who does the looking - to the end and at the end?
  - If what Solon says is true, you can't ever know if you're happy, only others can after you've died
  - Croesus' change of mind after his downfall: "Solon is the one whom I would have every king consult, regardless of the expense"
    - Cycle of confidence and downfall ever-present in Herodotus
    - Sudden pivot of someone of high fortune being brought down
- Sudden burst of statuary in the Archaic period
  - Kore (maiden) - statue of a young woman
  - Kouros (young man) - statue of a male youth
  - Larger than life-size, tend to look generally the same
    - Static, rigid, fixed
    - Clothed women, nude men
    - Often not ascribed to a particular person
  - Why are they young people?
    - Reflect the fact that these people died young?
    - Old people, but remembered for when they looked their best?
    - Do they represent that person or some generic offering to the gods?
      - Idealization vs. reality?
  -  Burial markers/tombstone marking the grave of where someone would've been buried
  - Absence of inscription leaves the person's identity anonymous
  - Possibly a borrowing from Egypt
  - Reassertion of identity by the aristocrats => individuals represent the class
  - Precedent?
    - Small Bronze Votive found near Thebes
    - Dedicated to the god Apollo
  - Agalma
    - Glory or honor
    - Pleasing offering to the gods
    - Statue
- Songs as a way of pausing in the midst of turmoil and strife
  - Sappho as a window into lyric poetry
    - One of the most famous poets in antiquity
    - Best preserved female poet from the Greeks (7th - 6th century)
    - Comments about Sappho, ancient and modern
      - "Sappho is a wonder. For we know in all recorded history not one woman who can even come close to rivaling her in the grace of her poetry"
      - "Sappho sang many contradictory things about Eros"
      - "It would be hard to think of another poet whose status is so disproportionate to the size of her surviving body of work"
    - Solon loved Sappho
    - Examples of rejection of the world of epic
  - What is Lyric "Poetry"?
    - Often involves a first-person voice, whether it's a voice of the singer or composer
    - Tends away from the heroic world of epic
      - World of personal expression, loss, desire, failure
    - Performed through song in antiquity
      - Emotional difference between song and words on a page
    - The Preoccupations of Lyric
      - Unrequited desire
      - Ephemerality of experience
      - Pleasure
      - Death



## Lecture 11: The Origins of “Inquiry” and the Greco-Persian Wars

- Guide for the Week: Transitioning from Archaic Age to Classical Age
  - Today: introduction to Herodotus and the Greco-Persian Wars
  - Wednesday: conclusions of above (including brief remarks on battles), with spotlight on Greek constructions of the Persians
  - Friday: further developments in Athens
- Herodotus of Halicarnassus, author of *The Histories*
  - Responsible, at least in part, for the invention of authorship
  - Contrast with not knowing who/if Homer was
    - Homer comes from a tradition of reciting Homeric poetry
    - Herodotus makes a claim they want to stand by, taking some authority/possession over their own work
      - "This is the display of the historia of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that neither human events become faint with time, nor that the tremendous and wondrous accomplishments, some displayed by Greeks, some by barbarians, become things without glory, and everything else, including the reason for which they went to war with each other."
        - Historia - things Herodotus has seen or inquired about
        - "human events" - contrasts with the superhuman qualities of epic
        - "some displayed by Greeks, some by barbarians" - focus on, not only the Greeks, but the other as well
        - "become things without glory" - connection to Homer while actively contrasting with him
    - Herodotus would also present his work (or at least parts of it) orally
    - Shift from poetry to prose => huge intellectual revolutions
      - From the realm of myth and meter to the language of everyday speech
      - Says that Herodotus is telling you something important in the ordinary discourse of everyday
- Herodotus' Inquiry (historia) Into...
  - The growth of the Persian Empire, which includes:
    - Egypt: its customs, its wonders, its animals (cats, alligators, hippos)
      - Persia's attempted takeover of Scythia
    - The Ionian Revolt (revolt by Eastern Greeks from Persian Rule)
    - The ultimate clash between Persia and Greeks
  - Hinting at the consequences of victory for Athens and Greece (Herodotus is writing about the Greco-Persian Wars during the later war between Athens and Sparta)
    - Setting up a parallel => is Athens becoming the new Persia?
  - Full of digression?
    - Building up a rich, multi-faceted sense of the two central civilizations
    - Context
- Among Herodotus' Intellectual Influences? Heraclitus of Miletus (535 - 475 BCE)
  - "Let us not make arbitrary conjectures about great matters"
  - "Everything flows and nothing abides"
    - Herodotus' casting of his narrative as a road => interest in change and movement
  - "War is the common condition... all things comes to pass through the compulsion of strife"
    - Writing about the preconditions and after-effects of the war
- Herodotus' Wheel of Fortune
  - "For cities that were great in early times have become small, and those that were great in my time were formerly small. Knowing, therefore, that human happiness never abides in the same place, I will make equal mention of both."
    - "those that were great in my time were formerly small" => historicization of the present
    - "I will make equal mention of both" => make mention of all aspects of the narrative for the future
      - What might one day be important become unimportant and vice versa?
- Solon and Croesus: a "Programmatic" Story?
  - Tells us how to read the rest of Herodotus
- Herodotus' Famous Recusal
  - "I have an obligation to relay the things that are said to me, but to believe them is in no way my duty. And you can let this utterance (epos) apply to the entirety of my account (logos)."
    - logos = "account, story"
    - Not mythos or epos
    - Distances himself from the entirety of his narrative 
  - Tells us what others say
  - How much validity does Herodotus give to the other tales?

- Achaemenid Kings of Persia
  - Cyrus the Great
    - Conquerer of the Medes
  - Cambyses
    - Conquest of Egypt
  - Darius I
    - Responsible for Persian incursions into Scythia
    - King during Ionian Revolt
    - invasion at Marathon
  - Xerxes
    - Responsible for bridging of Hellespont
    - Invasion of Greece for Thermopylae and Salamis
    - King at time of Persian defeat
  - Pattern of high achievement followed by swift downfall => characteristic of tragedy
  - Increasing sense of "more, more, more"
  - Downfall of this massive civilization acts as a source of Greek pride
- The Persian Empire: Some Notable Aspects
  - Satrapies (provinces), governed by satraps
  - Persians quite tolerant of various religions, customs, etc. of the people they conquered as long as they pay tribute to the Persian king
    - Respect for religiosity: Cyrus' restoration of the Jews in Babylonian exile and Darius' command to a satrap not to dishonor land sacred to a foreign god (Apollo)
    - Don't tread upon the people you rule over, so long as they show you respect
  - Network of roads allowed for tribute payments to king
  - Persia's rule wanted to spread into Greece
- As you read Herodotus, consider...
  - Conventional view states that Herodotus stresses differences between Greeks and Persians
    - Many scholars now question that view: in fact, a few prominent Scholars believe that Herodotus is showing the similarities between the Persian Empire and what would become the Athenian Empire of Herodotus' own time
  - In what ways are the Persians and Greeks differentiated, and in what ways does Herodotus imply important similarities between them?
    - It is notable, for instance, that one of the most intense debate scenes in *The Histories* occurs among the Persians as they consider whether or not to go to war
  - Greece != Persia is an oversimplification of how things were
  - Athens trying to throw off tyranny in the Archaic Age, contrasts with the Divine King of Persian rule
- Major Events in the Greco-Persian Wars
  - Ionian Revolt (499 - 494 BCE)
    - Centered in Eastern Greece (colonies on the coast of Asia Minor)
      - Under Persian rule, but had ties to Greece
      - Obligation by mainland Greece to come to the aid of their colonies?
      - Ruled often by tyrants who ostensibly served the Persian king
        - Many wanted to expand their own power (Aristagoras)
    - The Help of Athens
      - First area (Miletus) that instigates revolt has an ancestral tie to Athens => do they have to contribute?
      - "Aristagoras could not persuade Cleomenes of Lacedaemon, who was all alone, but he succeeded with thirty thousand Athenians"
      - "These twenty ships were the beginning of evils for Greeks and barbarians"
      - Seems to blame Athens
  - Battle of Marathon
  - Battle of Thermopylae
  - Battle of Salamis
- Herodotus is Complicated. Embrace that.
  - How does Herodotus depict the Persians?
  - How does the narration of Marathon and Thermopylae serve Greek cultural memory and/pr Greek stereotypes about Persians?
  - How do the Greco-Persian Wars contribute to a sense of Greek unity - and later, to a Greek sense of hubris?



## Lecture 12: Barbarians in Mind: The Construction of the “Other”

- Question about Herodotus's Cosmopolitan Outlook
  - "Custom is king of all"
    - Everyone thinks their worldview is superior to others
    - It may not even be a good idea to try and make people change
      - Tolerance of the Persian Empire
  - Worldview shaped by his being a mixture of Carrion and Greek
- Ionian Revolt: Failure and Fallout (494 BCE)
  - Persians install democracies to tyrants in Ionia (Western Asia Minor inhabited by Greeks)
  - Again, idea of Persian tolerance: form of government in subject cities did not matter to Persia, it seems, so long as tribute was paid
  - Persian expansionism would eventually mean knocking on mainland Greece's door, asking for "earth and water" (submission to Persian king)
- The Notion of Tisis (requital, revenge)
  - Darius' motivation of revenge against Athenian aid in the burning of the Ionian city of Sardis
  - See also the opening stories in Herodotus about the reciprocal kidnapping of women => idea is one of constant back-and-forth, of revenge and requital
  - Important for understanding much of the history of the Greco-Persian War
    - Tisis as a model for understanding much of the *Histories*
- Battle of Marathon (490 BCE)
  - Mythical origins: Hippias and the motherland
  - Persians outnumber the Greeks 2:1
  - Greeks fighting as hoplite soldiers
    - Lack of single commander, battle is a joint effort
    - Line up in a phalanx formation
  - Greeks make a dead run at the invading Persians
    - Inspired confusion in the Persian force
  - Persians routed, difficult to retreat
    - 6400 Persian deaths, 192 Greek deaths
  - Greeks who fought at Marathon became heroes
    - Those who died were worshipped
    - Resonance of the Homeric world
  - Despite victory, much of Athens was destroyed, as Persian ships sailed around the cape
- King Xerxes to Avenge his Father Darius
  - Xerxes' decision to invade, initially hesitant, before a figure in a dream tells him to do so
  - Sense of divine ordering, fate, tragedy => Herodotus as between myth and history
    - How do we interpret Xerxes' role in this conflict? Villain or victim?
  - Massive march and the bridging of Asia and Europe (and its hubris?)
    - Requital against the sea itself
  - Spartan herald incident
- Battle of Thermopylae (480 BCE)
  - Despite the Greek loss, the heroism of King Leonidas and the 300 is the legacy that lives on
  - A Greek traitor reveals to the Persians a flank that eventually leads to a Greek defeat
  - Parallels between Leonidas and Patroclus in Herodotus' narrative
  - Military loss, moral victory
- Battle of Salamis
  - Arguably the end of the war
  - Sea battle => navy funded by Themistocles
    - Athenians better than Persians at sea
  - Herodotus claims the Athenians proved themselves to be the saviors of Greece
  - Defeat of the Persians has created an identity for Greece
    - "we are all Greeks - a people of one blood speaking one common language, with temples to the gods and religious sites in common, and with a common way of life."

- Greek "Meagerness" vs. Persian Riches
  - Another ideology that arises from the Greco-Persian War
- Plutarch on Greco-Persian Wars
  - Contrast of being under Roman rule, but claiming the freedom of Greece



## Lecture 13: Was Athens a Democracy?

- The Classical Age (479 - 338 BCE)
  - Period of great intellectual and artistic achievement in Athens
  - As the city grows, we now measure its confidence and growth vs. its exercising of force over its allies
- The Hellenic League (between Sparta and Athens) was formed during the Greco-Persian Wars
  - Set aside differences, formed a common cause to unite against the Persians
  - Sparta was considered the superior military power => leaders of the Hellenic League
  - Athens' naval force (in particular at Salamis) leaves the question: who should be in charge moving forward?
    - Naval strength, colonial allies in Asia Minor, proximity to Persia
  - The Delian League is formed in 477 BCE
    - Athens and its allies
    - Headed by Athens
    - Defends Greece from continued threat from Persia
    - Member states give money or ships to Athens, but maintain their own autonomy

- Athens begins to express their power against the Delian League in self-interested ways
  - Takeover of Skyros and Karystos and enslavement of its people, in the name of fortifying its defenses against Persia
    - Really, just control of sea route by which grain is transported to Athens
  - "Seizure and massacre were the vocabulary of empire, and the Athenians spoke this language from the very beginning."
- Democracy: demos ("people") + kratos ("power")
  - Important concepts to weigh:
    - Power distribution vs. centralization
    - Access within distribution of power
      - Who can be in office, who can vote, etc.
    - Limits on power
      - Rotationality, non-repeatability of office, term limits, etc.
      - Exception: generals (strategoi) => Perikles
  - Ekklesia (the Assembly)
    - Open to any male citizen, so long as they had undergone military training
      - Originally, citizens were defined as 18+ males with an Athenian father
      - Later (451 BCE) changed so that citizens must have Athenian mothers and father in an effort to stop marital alliances
    - Various things may take place
      - Presentation of the tributes from Athens' allies
  - Randomizing the Eponymous Archon
    - Polemarch (military magistrate)
    - Archon Basileus (religious official/high priest)
    - Eponymous Archon (nominal head of state for one year)
      - Originally voted from eligible pool
      - 487 BCE => random selection of eligible candidates (klerosis ek prokriton)
        - Prevention of blocks of power forming around a single personality, bribes, etc.
      - 458/7 BCE => third category of Solonian class system (zeugitai) became eligible
  - Misthos
    - The money that is given to you to be a jury member
    - Gives an incentive to jury service
  - Theorikon
    - Treasury used to subsidize theater tickets for the poor
  - Kimon (510 - 450 BCE)
    - Last gasp of the aristocratic power-mongers in Athens
    - Son of a military hero from the Battle of Marathon
    - A general that continued to repel the Persians in the wake of the Greco-Persian War
    - Open to alliance with the Spartans at the time of the Delian League's formation
  - Further Parts of Athenian Government (politeia)
    - Council of the Areopagus
    - Boule
  - Ephialtes and Democratic Reforms
    - Diminished power of the Council of the Areopagus
      - Areopagus composed of former archons in lifetime role
      - Chief functions: dokimasia and homicide court
    - Ephialtes moves power away from the Council and towards the Boule and Ekklesia
  - Dokimasia (conducted by the Boule)
    - One must not have abused or neglected his parents
    - One cannot have refused military service or thrown away his shield
    - One cannot have sold himself for sexual pleasure to another man
    - One must not have spent his patrimony
  - Boule (The Council of 500)
    - Prytanis (name of fifty Council members for the one-month period)
    - Once you have served, you cannot serve for 10 years
    - You write the stuff that Assemblies will vote on
    - Review the accounts of outgoing officials
    - Ensure that public building projects were moving forward, caring for ships, collecting taxes
  - Law Courts
    - Nothing like our modern-day rules of evidence and procedure
    - Frequent use of "character assassination"
    - Asserting without good evidence, for instance, that someone did not pass dokimasia
- Democracy and Empire
- More on Athenian Empire/Delian League
  - Naval dominance/protection
  - Oaths of allegiance
  - Movement of treasury from Delos to Athens

  - Colonies and cleruchies (dispatched groups who remained loyal to Athens, especially as soldiers)
  - Tribute from allies (phoros)
- The Egyptian "Disaster" (460 BCE)
  - Part of the reason the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens
  - Egypt attempts to rebel against the Persians
  - Athens attempts to help, but fails miserably
    - Showcase that Athens isn't as powerful as they think



## Lecture 14: Social Death: The Lives of Slaves

- Categories of Slave in Ancient Greece
  - Mainly talking about chattel (from the same root as cattle" and "capital"): slaves that were owned by other people
    - "Income-earning bodies"
  - Douloi: miners and field workers (cleaners, gardeners, harvesters)
  - Oiketai: household slaves (porters, cooks, bakers, meal-grinders, but also tutors, shippers, personal assistants, torch-bearers)
  - Public slaves (demosioi): clerks for the Boule, police force of archers (?), workers in the mint
  - Choris oikountes: "those dwelling apart"
    - Seems to refer to slaves that worked in some kind of manufacturing/craftsmenship
    - Didn't live with the people that owned them
    - Might have beem able to buy their way to freedom based on their productivity
  - Dehumanizing terms: andrapodo - "a thing with the feet of a man", konipodes - "the dusty feet"

  - Vast majority of slaves came from somewhere else
  - The transformation of the word barbarian from simply "others" to "inferiors"
  - "Elsewhere in Thrace they sell their children for export abroad... Thracians consider it best not to work, and working the land is regarded as the most dishonorable profession. The best way to make a living, in their judgement, is off the spoils of war"
  - "Barbarians are slaves, but Greeks are free"
  - War => more captives and slaves
    - "It is the universal and unchanging custom of men that when a city is captured in war, the citizens' persons and property belong to the captors"
- Pricing
  - From the so-called "Attic Stelai" from 414 BCE
  - Drachma ~ roughly a day's earnings for a skilled worker or soldier
  - 2 Syrian slaves: 301 and 240 drachmae
  - 3 Thracian women: 220, 165, and 135 drachmae, respectively
  - Carian (= Halicarnassian) boy: 72 drachmae
- Other Rules and Exemptions
  - Slaves could take part in the first day of the City Dionysia, the great festival in honor of Dionysus
  - If of Greek ancestry, a slave could be initiated into the so-called Eleusynian Mysteries, a religious cult often thought to be connected to ideas of afterlife and rebirth
  - But slaves couldn't use the main three gymnasia in Athens
  - Owners couldn't murder their own slaves, and if the did, they had to undergo purification so as not to be cursed: "the murder of any human being was offensive to the gods"
    - Slaves could beg for mercy on the Areopagus in hopes of being bought by another owner, but they found not refuge in the judicial system
  - Sex between and children from slaves was a "reward" for good behavior
  - Slaves sometimes buried in family plots along with owners
- Schole ("leisure" => school, scholarship)
  - Looking at the dynamic of cultural achievement of the Greeks and the labor forces they employed
  - Slavery and others' leisure and/or success: "I cannot yet afford to buy a slave to take over my trade"
- Choris oikountes ("those dwelling apart")
  - Skilled slaves who might live away from their owners for various reasons
  - Rendered an apophora (basic income) to their owner, but would be allowed to keep extra beyond base wage and possibly purchase their own freedom
- Trying to Image Slaves' Lives
  - We don't have written testimony from slaves, just various attempts by authors to write from their shoes
- Exploitation and Punishment
  - The slave's body was site of abuse and punishment
    - Slaves were whipped for court proceedings to elicit information, and by their owners
    - "If a slave might not be beaten by anyone else, he might certainly be beaten by his master"
  - Keeping slaves in check: low rations, locking them up, locking up food supply
  - Bodies as owned (new slaves showered with figs and nuts, similar to bridal entry)
    - Slaves of Alkestis regarded her as mother
  - Working in worst places: e.g. the Laureion, the silver mine near Athens, in dangerous conditions
  - "Social death" - when there are people in society who are not regarded as fully human by other members of society
    - Within the context of their society, they are dead
  - Sokrates condemns carpenters, smiths, and cobblers as mostly "slavish" becuase of thier ignorance of beauty and justice
    - Condescension towards menial labor
- Aristotle: mastery => usefulness
  - "Whereas the master is merely the slave's master and does not belong to the slave, the slave is not merely the slave of the master but wholly belongs to the master. These considerations therefore make clear the nature of the slave and his essential quality: one who is a human being belonging by nature not to himself but to another is by nature a slave, and a person is a human being belonging to another if being a man he is an article of property, and an article of property is an instrument for action separable from its owner"
  - "by nature", "by essence"
- Slavery as Metaphor for Athenian Rule over Allies in Delian League?
  - "As the essential fact about a slave seemed to be that he had to take the orders of his master, so the essential fact about the subject allies seemed to be that they had to take the orders of Athens"
- Some Other Considerations
  - No know slave revolts at Athens
    - Debate about whether slaves did or did not outnumber free people
    - Lower-class people had no slaves and lower-middle-class might own only 1 or 2
    - Contrast with Sparta, where helots outnumbered the people 2:1
  - Slaves may not have revolted, but they did flee
    - In 433 BCE, Athens barred citizens of the city of Megara from the Athenian agora and harbors in part because Megara had given refuge to runaway slaves
    - During the Peloponnesian War in the mid- to late-5th century BCE, some 20,000 slaves fled, despite knowledge that treatment was unlikely to be better in Sparta
- Anxiety and Self-Considering?
  - "One thing only brings disgrace to a slave: the name of slave. In all else an honest slave is a match for a free person"
  - "We have become barbarous to one another, since by nature we are all of us in all respects equally adapted to be barbarians or Greeks"
    - We can choose how to behave
  - Not much in the way of opposition, these sorts of statements are rare



## Lecture 15: What Is (Greek) Tragedy?

- "What a tragedy!"
  - There are no surviving Greek tragedies about natural disasters
  - More often, Greek tragedies refer to the complex situations of individuals and families and their reversals of fortune
    - Focus on the actions that these characters take in relation to some kind of crisis
    - Decisions made with limited knowledge, leading to further suffering
- Two Potential Models for Explaining Tragedy
  - Historicizing Model: ancient context explains tragedy best
  - Humanist Model: ancient tragedy is something about humans that other humans respond to, regardless of original context
- Three Major Tragedians with Extant Works
  - Aeschylus (525 - 456 BCE)
  - Sophocles (497 - 405 BCE)
    - General, saw a certain kind of human suffering
    - Wrote about interpersonal conflicts
  - Euripides (480 - 406 BCE)
- Historicizing: Tragedy as a Ritual
  - Dithyramb - choral song or hymn, often in honor of Dionysus
  - "Goat song" (tragos + ode)
  - Costumed and stylized
  - Details of red-figure krater depicting actors preparing for a play
  - Tragedy performed behind masks by males, focus on the sound, not the appearance of the actor
- Theatre of Dionysus, Athens
  - Plays took place during the Dionysia, a festival in honor of Dionysus
  - Dionysus is the god of the radical other
  - The Dionysia as Spring Break?
    - The plays often have to do with civic matters, what is right or just in the eyes of the gods
    - While celebratory, tragedies were still self-reflective, discussing the meanings of knowledge and ignorance
- A few other historicizing details
  - Skene, ekkyklema, mechane
  - Chorus
    - Strophe
    - Antistrophe
  - Stichomythia
  - March, dirge, hymn, dance (moods of rhythm and music)
- The Humanist Model
  - "Ancient tragedy is not ancient. It is quintessentially modern"
  - "Tragedy presents a conflictually constituted world defined by ambiguity, uncertainty, and unknowability. Tragedy is the experience of transcendental opacity"
    - At the state of being at your own limit, you see all that you don't know
- "Tragic Consciousness"
  - Humans and human actions in ancient tragedy are presented "not as stable realities that can be placed, defined, or judged, but as problems, unanswerable questions, riddles whose double meaning remain enigmatic however often decoded"
- "No-Choice Choices"
  - Tragedy as about dilemma and impossible situations
  - Example of Antigone
    - "Which of the gods can I summon to my side – I, whose piety has made me impious?"
  - Example of Agamemnon (in Aeschylus' *Agamemnon*)
    - "He put on the harness of necessity"
- Humanist Model? Aristotle on Tragedy in the *Poetics*
  - "Tragedy... is an imitation of an action that is serious and complete, and which has some greatness about it... It imitates people performing actions and does not rely on narration. It achieves through pity and fear, the katharsis ("cleansing") of these sorts of feelings"
  - Hamartia - mistake, error
- Sophocles' *Antigone*
  - Stages questions about what makes the family a locus of importance
- Piety and Defiance
  - "To act in defiance of the citizens (biai politon) my nature does not give me means for that" - Ismene
  - "Had I been a mother of children, and my husband dead and rotten, I would not have taken this weary task upon me against the will of the city" - Antigone
    - Consistency with her actions?
- Antigone and the Impossible Family
  - "I know I am pleasing those I should please most" - Antigone
  - "If you can do it. But you are in love with the impossible (amechanon eras)" - Ismene
  - Antigone erotically charged with the love of her brother, reiteration of the incest she's descended from (Oedipus)
- Instability of Power: Creon
  - Creon articulates the idea that your greatest friend is your community/country, not a particular individual
- Choral "Ode to Man" (really, "human")
  - "Many are wonders, the terrors, and none is more wonderful, more terrible, than man."
  - Pay attention to how contradictory humans are in their actions
  - Cannot stop death
- Antigone's "Transcendental Opacity"
  - You can't cheat death, so you must honor those who have died
  - No human has jurisdiction over death
  - Antigone's Claim
    - "no brother's life would bloom for me again"
    - The irreplaceability of the relationship
- Some Questions for Reading Tragedy
  - What aspects of the historicizing approach help you to understand tragedy?
  - In what ways do the plays present their apparent antagonists as similar to each other
  - What makes these plays so attractive for the humanist approach to reading?



## Lecture 16: Sexuality in Ancient Athens

- Some Midterm Information
  - Material from weeks 1-5
    - Greek Terms
    - Images in slides that are also in the book
    - Primary source readings
  - Bring 2 blue books at the normal class time, 11/5
  - No make-up exams
- Eros
  - From Proto-Indo-European root: ero, "to separate, to adjoin"
  - Probably erasthai, "to love, to be separated?" => erotic
  - Probably eris, "strife, discord"
- Asymmetry of Power
  - Emphasis on actions and behaviors, rather than identities
- Pederasty
  - "Love of young boys"
  - Attempt to avoid judgement based on contemporary standards
  - Rather to inquire into its function in ancient Greek society
  - A recognized Greek practice
    - Zeus and Ganymede
      - Ganymede "was the loveliest born of the race of mortals, and therefore the gods caught him away to themselves, to be Zeus' wine pourer, for the sake of his beauty, so he might be among the immortals"
      - Ganymede => catamite ("a boy kept for homosexual purposes")
      - Story becomes a model 
  - Male-Male Sexual Experience in Athens
    - Erastes - the older male; "the lover" (active partner)
      - Meant to instigate the relationship
    - Eromenos - younger male, with upper age limit 17-22 (?); "the beloved" (passive partner)
      - Meant to be courted
  - Why the Pederastic Relationship?
    - Brothers in arms?
      - Example of the Theban Sacred Band (4th century BCE)
      - Achilles and Patroclus (?)
      - Harmodius and Aristogeiton
      - Male-male relationships as the backbone for military achievement
    - Supplement to marital sex?
      - Women were confined to the home, while men were out
    - Idea of tutoring/sponsoring => the erastes leading the eromenos into society?
      - Problem of "elite evidence"
  - Asymmetry of Pleasure?
    - Seems that the erastes was the one deriving pleasure
    - Socrates: "A youth [the eromenos] does not share in the pleasure of the intercourse as a woman does, but looks on, sober, at another in love's intoxication"
  - The Anachronism of the Term "Homosexuality"
    - Charles Gilbert Chaddock - 1892 "homo sexuality", rendering of a German term
    - Homosexuality presupposes "sexuality": "a specifically sexual dimension to the human personality, a characterological seat within the individual of sexual acts, desires, and pleasures - a determinate source from which all sexual expression proceeds"
      - "Instead of attempting to trace the history of 'homosexuality' as if it were a thing, therefore, we might more profitably analyze how the significance of same-sex sexual contacts have been variously constructed over time by members of human-living groups"
  - Three Major Scholars of Ancient Sexuality
    - Foucault
    - Halpern
  - Kalos and Kinaidos
    - To be a desirable eromenos was to be kalos ("beautiful")
    - But to be a grown adult and in a sexual relationship with another grown adult was not viewed well => kinaidos
    - Court-case called *Against Timarchus*



## Lecture 17: The Parthenon

- Athenian Self-Definition: The Acropolis
  - Main buildings originate from the reign of Peisistratus
    - Mostly destroyed by the Persians during the Greco-Persian Wars
  - City center rebuilt after the Persian Wars, using funding from the Delian League
    - What might allied states have been thinking when they saw where their tribute was going?
  - Temple of Athena Parthenos => Parthenon (447 - 432 BCE)
    - Part of the rebuilding effort under Pericles
    - Frieze, Metopes, and Pediment Sculptures
      - Decorated not by gods or heroes, but by actual people
  - Panathenaic Procession Frieze, Parthenon (c. 440 - 432 BCE)
    - Depiction of of procession bringing in garments to wrap around the statue of Athena
    - Belief that the statue was the goddess herself
  - South Frieze
    - Glorification of the citizenry of Athens
    - Located in a place difficult to see by humans => almost as if for the gods themselves
  - Metopes
    - Depictions of human conquest
    - Dynamic, lively, etc.
  - The "Elgin" Marbles
- "Religion"
  - No word for this in Ancient Greek
  - No real separation of the sacred and the secular
  - Polis Religion
    - Religion in ancient Greece seems to be something done publicly
    - Binding self to the community
    - Brauron Sancutary
      - Evidence of a sanctuary of Artemis
      - Religious activity specific to young women
        - Marking of growth throughout maturation
      - "Playing the bear"
  - "Technologies" of Orthopraxy
    - "Doing the right thing"
      - Performing the ritual properly
    - Sacrifice and libation
    - Religion as performative
  - Votive tablet - a tablet depicting your own religious activity
    - Re-inscribed your own activity in perpetuity
  - Gods are very much anthropomorphic
    - In some sense, the Greeks tell stories about themselves and their values
    - What are the Greeks saying about the nature of the gods in the *Bacchae*
  - Priests and Priestesses
    - Not a vocation, no ordination
    - Older priesthoods reserved for nobility; held for life
    - Example of Lysimache (priestess) who served for 64 years
    - Dealt with and ate a lot of meat due to sacrifice
    - No personal ministry not hatching/matching/dispatching
    - External qualifications (rather than belief or intellect)
      - Prostitutes, army deserters, and debtors ineligible
      - No physical blemishes! => your offerings are tainted
    - Plato's Laws: Priests and priestesses are people who "know how to offer our gifts to the gods in sacrifices so as to please them, and who know, also, the right way to pray to the gods so they bestow blessings"
  - Eleusis: Religion as Personal and Civic?
    - Maybe some kind of hallucination during this ritual where you would see some of the "gods"
      - Kykeon
    - Gave assurance of a person's afterlife
    - Presentation of gifts of the earth to Demeter
    - Gephyrismos => as you crossed the bridge (began hallucinating), you have insults hurled at you, providing pollution to cleanse yourself of
  - Belief
    - No one "sacred text" among ancient Greeks
    - Homer and Hesiod were primary resources (including the Homeric hymns) => "Internet" idea, but also, like our internet, not without contradiction, and no centralized authority
    - Rarity of charges of asebeia (impiety)
    - At a broad level, belief appears to be common - and communally realized
- Dionysus and Euripides' *Bacchae*
  - Dionysus: god of wine, sexual liberation, inebriation, irrationality, and tragedy
  - What is Dionysus demanding of Pentheus? Ritual? Belief?
  - Role of women
  - Moral? Nature of the god?



## Lecture 18: The Art of Persuasion: Healers, Presocratics, Sophists

- Asklepios
  - During the 5th century and beyond, Asklepios received a lot of attention from those who were sick
  - Would go to the Askelpeion for treatment, offering sacrifices and libations in return
  - Evidence seen in votive tablets
    - Inscription of Asklepios healing a subject, supported by the goddess Hygieia
  - A rare instance in which religion was more personal than community-based
  - "Ambrosia from Athens, blind of one eye. She came as a suppliant to the god. Going around the shrine she mocked some of the cures as incredible and impossible, if the lame and blind could become whole by having a dream. But when she slept in the shrine the god, standing over her, seemed to say that he would cure her, but that he would require her to donate to the temple a silver pig as a memorial of her unbelief. Saying this, he cut open her diseased eye and poured in a drug. When day came she went away cured."
    - Note the transactional nature of this interaction
    - The inscription itself is possibly an act of persuasion for readers
  - Aelios Aristeides (2nd century CE)
    - His writing attests for the everlasting nature of Asklepios' influence
  - Early ideas of healing/medical practice
- Hippokrates of Kos
  - Considered the founder of ancient medicine
  - "I swear by Apollo the healer, Asklepios, Hygieia, and Panacia, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgement the following oath and agreement..."
  - Tension between thinking of the body in a scientific/materialistic way and the will of the gods
    - Will ultimately move in the direction of modern medicine
  - Hippocratics interested in anything that could afflict the body
    - How to diagnose the cause => relation to Herodotus' studies of the Persian Wars
  - Medical Science
    - Four humors: melancholy, phlegmatic, sanguine, choleric
      - An imbalance of these humors would cause a body to have some infliction
    - "When this person returns to her right mind, women give to Artemis various offerings, especially the most valuable of women's robes, following the orders of oracles, but they are deceived. The fact is that the disorder is cured when nothing impedes the downward flow of blood."
- Presocratics
  - "Mortals believe that gods are begotten and have clothing, voice, and body like their own... But if oxen and horses and lions had hands and so could draw and make works of art like men, horses would draw pictures of gods like horses, and oxen like oxen, and they would make their bodies in accordance with the form they themselves severally possess"
    - Not necessarily disbelief
    - Seemingly a rationalization of conventional belief
  - Monism? Xenophanes
    - "There is one gods, greatest among gods and human beings, not at all like mortals in form nor yet in mind. All of him sees, all of him thinks, all of him hears"
  - Thales, Heraclitus, Anaximander
    - Origins and elements: Water? Fire? Earth? Air?
      - Early ideas of geology, biology, chemistry, etc.
    - To apeiron: boundless (Anaximander)
      - Elements (like the humors) must be in balance to be in harmony, achieving "to apeiron"
    - Humans as Fish (Thales)
      - Hypothesis that biology emerged when the sun had dried off enough moisture
      - Humans would therefore be a form of fish
    - Atoma (Democritus)
      - We can reduce material until we reach a point where it is impossible => hypothesized as the atom by
      - Atoma => the uncuttable
    - "You cannot step into the same river twice" (Heraclitus)
      - What is the relationship between dynamic and static objects?
    - Logos: "word, order, meaning" (Thales)
  - Rationalizing Belief?
    - "... when the laws prevented men from open deeds of violence, but they continued to commit them in secret, I believe that a man of shrewd and subtle mind invented for humans the fear of the gods, so that there might be something to frighten the wicked even if they acted, spoke, or thought in secret... So, I think, did someone persuade people to believe that there exists a race of gods"
- Sophists
  - Sophos => "wise"
  - Sophistes => "a wise man" => "wise guy"
    - Acquires a more negative connotation as time passes
    - "An expert is a fast-talking guy from out of town"
  - Associated with a challenging of conventional thinking
  - Sophistry, sophistic => tactics that sound good, but don't submit well to rationalization
  - Two important facts about Sophists
    - Not part of one philosophical "school"
    - Took a fee for their services
      - Public displays of their expertise, "higher education"
  - "Useful Majors"?
    - Pupils willing to pay high fees because sophists' "courses" were considered pathways to success
      - Assembly and law courts => persuasiveness
    - Linguistics, rhetoric, geometry, music theory, and eristics
      - Eristics (debate): "Black is white, 1 + 1 = 3, the sun is actually the moon, the weaker argument is the stronger", etc.
    - Protagoras (490 - 420 BCE) => "Man is the measure of all things"
    - "As to the gods, I do not know whether they exist or not."
  - Sophists were important in part because there were no lawyers
    - Litigants brought their own cases and represented themselves
    - Might have delivered speech written by a logographos
      - People also wrote their own and delivered them
    - Content and oratorical ability might be shaped by a sophist
  - Smart != Wise
    - "Your tongue is fluent and you sound so smart, but there is no true wisdom in your words."
    - Does knowledge mean deep understanding?
      - What even is knowledge?
  - What is logos?
    - "Logos is a great ruler (dynastes), who with the smallest and least visible body accomplishes divine works: for logos is able (dunatai) to stop fear, remove pain, create joy..." - Gorgias
    - Logos as unmoored from the truth?
      - People don't follow reason, they follow belief
  - Aristotle on Rhetoric and Truth
    - Originally, Aristotle says that rhetoric is about persuasion (peitho) instead of truth, meaning rhetoric is about knowing what an audience believes
    - Rhetoric is concerned with persuasion through general beliefs (koina) and beliefs already widely accept (endoxa)
      - Similar to Gorgias' statements
    - But Aristotle goes on to say humans have a natural disposition for the truth, therefore aiming for commonly held beliefs *is* aiming at the truth
      - Different to Gorgias' statements
      - Optimism that people generally know what is true



## Lecture 19: The Peloponnesian War

- The Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE)
  - Delian League (Athens and its allies) vs. Peloponnesian League (Sparta and its allies)
  - Source for the war: Thucydides' *History*
  - Ends in Athenian defeat by Sparta
    - Rule of the Spartan Oligarchs at Athens
- Thucydides (c. 460 - 400) and the *History*
  - Sober, cold, rational work contrasts with the cosmopolitan nature of Herodotus
  - Calls the war a kinesis (movement, disturbance of energy, etc.)
  - Refers to **to anthropinon** (the human thing)
    - Continuation of Herodotus and "the workings of humans"
  - Will not find **to mythodes** (the mythical/story-like/delightful thing)
    - Advancement of historical writing
    - Writing is often brutal and grievous
  - Proem to *History of the Peloponnesian War*
    - Thucydides, an Athenian, recorded the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, writing how they waged it against each other and beginning his work as soon as the war broke out in expectation that it would be  a major one and notable beyond all previous wars, basing this assumption on the fact that both sides came to it flourishing in overall preparedness and on seeing that the rest of the Hellenes were aligning themselves with one or the other, some immediate and others at least intending to. This was certainly the greatest disturbance...
    - Claim that this war is the most importance event ever written about
  - Method and Style
    - Truth and accuracy => "... the search for truth strains the patience of most people, who would rather believe the first things that come to hand."
    - Autopsy scrutinized => "And as for the real action of the war, I did not think it right to set down either what I head from people I happened to meet or what I merely believed to be true. Even for the events at which I was present myself, I tracked down detailed information from other sources as far as I could."
    - Speeches => "I have made each speaker say what I thought the situation demanded, keeping as near as possible to the general sense of what was actually said."
  - The professed legacy of the *History*
    - "This history may not be the most delightful to hear, since there is no mythology in it. But those who want to look into the truth of what was done in the past - which, given the human condition, will recur in the future, either in the same fashion or nearly so - those readers will find this *History* valuable enough..."
  - On the causes of the war
    - "The truest cause [**prophasis**], but least publicized, I consider to be the fact that the Athenians becoming great and alarming the Spartans, forced them into war"
      - Prophasis => truest cause/pretext, oxymoronic
    - During the Greco-Persian War, the Spartans had developed a great land force, while the Athenians had developed a great naval force
    - Spartans claimed land from Attica, but often had to retreat to fight the helots at home
      - Pericles has walls constructed around the city, bringing people from Attica into the city itself
- The Funeral Oration of Pericles
  - "As a didactic speech, the funeral oration does not so much console as explain and exalt"
- The Plague at Athens
  - "No one could remember a disease that was so great or so destructive of human life breaking out anywhere before. Doctors, not knowing what to do, were unable to cope with it at first, and no other human knowledge was any use either... Prayers in temples, questions to oracles - all practices of that kind turned out tot be useless also, and in the end people fave them up, defeated by the evil of the disease"
    - Actually stopped belief in the divine
  - Nomoi (customs) and Phusis (nature)
  - Reinforcement of his own methods
    - "Now, let each man, doctor or layman, speak about it according to his understanding, what its origin is likely to have been and whatever causes of so great a change he thinks are sufficiently powerful to bring about disturbance. I will say what it was like in its course and describe here..."
  -  Visible and Invisible?
  - Nature and Beyond Nature



## Lecture 20: The Peloponnesian War II

- Trgaic Patterning?

  - Melian Dialogue: Athens threatens and invades the neutral place of Melos
  - etc.

- Peripeteia ("reversal")

  - "Reversal is a change of the opposite direction of events... in accord, as we insist, with probability or necessity"

- The Melian Dialogue (416 BCE)

  - Melos didn't firmly ally itself with either Athens or Sparta
  - Why did Athens find interest in subduing this neutral territory?
    - Accruing more power, glory, etc.?
  - Athens launches ships to Melos, demanding their surrender
    - Text shows a dialogue between Athens and Melos, showing why Melos refuses to surrender
    - Men are slaughtered, women and children are enslaved
  - Told in dramatic form, without narration, presenting only the speakers as through actors on a stage
  - Form of dialogue reminds us of tragedy, and the tense back-and-forth exchanges between central characters such as those between Antigone and Creon (stichomythia)
  - There is also a correspondence between the moral starkness of the dialogue's content and the radically pared-down form
  - Thucydides the narrator disappears, heightening the intensity of the exchange by isolating the 2 groups in a debate over life or death
  - Likely a scenario in which Thucydides tries to capture the "gist" of exchange
  - Example:
    - Athenians: "We would like to rule over you without trouble, and preserve you for our mutual advantage"
    - Melians: "But how could it be as much to our advantage to serve, as it is yours to rule?"
  - Realpolitik
    - Political realism, shorn of any appeals to ethics, loyalties, etc.
    - Emphasis on political "realism" or pragmatism rather than justice or moral principles
    - "in the human sphere judgements about justice are relevant only between those with an equal power to enforce it"
  - Athenian Advantage
    - "Nature always compels gods (we believe) and men (we are certain) to rule over anyone they can control. We did not make this law and we were not the first to follow it; but we will take it as we found it and leave it to posterity forever, because we know that you would do the same if you had our power"
      - Accuracy? => Thucydides does not present a flattering portrait of Athens
      - Utility? => Dangers of empire

- The Sicilian Expedition (415 - 413 BCE)

  - Greatest example of Athens' overreach

    - Would eventually doom Athens to fail throughout the rest of the war

  - Largest military action in Athenian history at the time

  - Athenian desire to move on Sicily for riches and expansion of empire

  - Nicias vs. Alcibiades: should we fight or not?

    - Nicias
      - Emphasizes that the Athenians have enemies both in the mainland and in Sicily => 2 wars at the same time
      - Claims that Alcibiades can profit off of the expedition
    - Alcibiades
      - More charismatic, convinces the Athenian demos

  - The Mutilation of the Herms

    - Herms often mark space as sacred or belonging to the city
      - Good luck, safe passage, protection, etc.
      - Representation of male power with a sense of anonymity and ubiquity
    - Heads of herms chopped off one night => terrible omen for the people of Athens

    - Alcibiades exiled for this act, but the expedition is still passed
      - People in charge of the expedition are now in charge of it

  - Hope and Desire

    - "The difficulty of equipping the expedition did not wipe out the Athenians' desire to make it; rather, it inflamed them all the more... Now everyone alike fell in love with the enterprise: old men hoped to subdue the place they went to... The young men were longing to see and study a far-off country and were confident they would be brought back safely... The result of this vehement desire of the majority was that anyone who did not favor the expedition kept quiet out of fear that if he held up his hand in opposition he would be thought to harbor ill will against the city"
    - Highlighting of the dangers of groupthink

  -  The Superlative Spectacle of War

    - Disproportionate amount of power for the issue at hand
    - Not so much an army being directed against its enemies, but a display of power and wealth
    - Reminiscent of Herodotus' depiction of the Persians

  - Ends with disaster

    - Athenian's refused to believe the totality of their defeat
    - Disjoint anger at the orators who promoted the expedition

  - No attempt from Thucydides to portray the event in any sort of patriotic way

    - "the most glorious victory fro the winners, and the worst calamity for the losers"

- Four Statements about Thucydides' Account

  - Accuracy is not the same as the representation of accuracy
    - Speeches could be considered accurate by ancient audiences, even if we might think otherwise
  - No telling "romanticized" stories and presenting an "unpleasant" work does not mean excluding stories of strong emotion, especially those that convey the greatness of Athenian failure in the war
    - Accounts of emotion relate to representations in Greek tragedy
  - Certain notions of objectivity (such as presenting opposed speeches) differ from modern-day notions of objectivity (accuracy of numbers, fact-checking, etc.)
  - Thucydides can issue universalizing statements about power (as in the Melian Dialogue) and then show them working out (or failing to work out) within his work, making good on his promise of writing a useful text: readers can "apply" his text to the text

- Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1st century BCE) on Thucydides

  - "Thucydides writes a single war, one that is neither noble nor fortunate: indeed, a war which ought not to have occurred, and, short of that, one that ought to have been committed to silence and oblivion and ignored by successive generations"
  - How to think of your own history as a subordinate of another power?

## Discussion 6: *Antigone*

- Tragedy

  - Ancient theater is in some ways the reverse of modern theater
    - Ancient theater is very much outward-facing => a facade
  - Hesitancy to write tragedy about Athens
    - Thebes as a parallel

- Antigone's family tree

  - Jocasta + Laius => Oedipus

    - Greek poets recycled different phases of stories => the "Theban cycle"
  - Pentheus and Dionysus are both trying to establish power over the people of Thebes
    - Feeling of instability in the rule of Thebes
    - Compare to Creon
      - Both act to enforce social order, but are met with divine interference
      - An inward threat (within the family tree) vs. an outward threat (foreign cult)
      - Creon is fighting an individual, not a society
  - Connection to sophism?
    - Dionysus vs. Pentheus in speech
    - Does Dionysus have to persuade Pentheus?
      - Unnatural change of opinion, lack of gradual persuasion, too abrupt of a shift

    - Actaeon, Semele, and Pentheus => all end up dead
    - Failure to respect the divine

- 



## Discussion 9:

- 



## Reading 1: Why Study the Greeks?

    - Mathematical theorems of Euclid
    - Democracy - **demos** (people) + **kratos** (rule)
    - Concepts of truth and beauty
- Truth and Beauty
  - Beauty in poetry and sculpting
    - Homer's Iliad
    - Sculpting of limestone and marble as learned from the Egyptians
      - Took the Egyptians' work and revolutionized it with a form of naturalism
  - Plato's *Symposium* describes how "the seeker of truth will hunt for the beauty to be found in all things"
    - The seeker will find beauty in bodies and also in laws and civil institutions
  - View culture in contrast to modern day pop culture
    - Shows us a battle between thoughtful, ethical engagement with the world and bland superficiality
      - Significance vs. triviality
    - Knowing the Greeks better = knowing ourselves better
  - **kore** - statue of a young woman
  - Ancient works compel us to ask questions of a strange, yet recognizable society
  - Greeks stand at the head of Western culture
    - Greeks are a model of perfection
    - We have a real and tangible connection to them, but it must be scrutinized
- Democracy, Ancient and Modern
  - In our world, democracy takes two forms: parliamentary and presidential
    - Franchise extends to both men and women 18+, citizens elect governments to represent them, and governments are answerable to the people
  - Greek democracy has its differences
    - No women
    - Foreigners given little chance to participate
    - Structure founded on slaves giving citizens the opportunity to participate
    - Male citizens voted in the **Ekklesia**, an Athenian assembly that voted on matters such as public contracts, taxes, and declarations of war
      - Direct democracy
      - Members of the **Boule** were elected representatives of their tribe at random, served for 1 year, and then couldn't serve again for 10
    - Athenians were the government
      - Government was not separate from the people
    - Denounced in that it favored the poor, not the higher class members of Greek society
  - Free societies are capable of the highest aspirations, but must confront their own shortcomings
    - Experience the tension between altruistic aspirations and conspicuous failures
    - Failure leads to the unveiling of social tension
      - The plague in Ancient Greece vs. Hurricane Katrina today
- Greek Architecture and Philosophy
  - Hard to imagine the Western world finding its expressions for power and national identity without the model of the Greeks
  - Orders of Greek architecture: Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian
  - Architectural vocabulary is derived from the styles and forms of the Greeks
  - Emphasizes the motifs of similarity and difference in our relationship with the Greeks
  - Western philosophy builds off of the work of the Greeks
    - Works are however outdated
      - Plato and Aristotle's work on slavery
      - Modern societies have to work with the elitist thinking of the Greeks when it comes to topics such as slavery and women's rights
- East versus West?
  - The championing of the Greeks results in the mindset that Western civilization is superior
    - The post-WWI state of the Middle East acts as a footnote in Western history, but is vastly significant to those in the Middle East (9/11)
  - We take on an obligation to understand the origin of our own societies before we continue to repeat mistakes of the past
    - Greeks vs. Persia
  - The defeat of Leonidas at Thermopylae is an example of the victors romanticizing the war, altering historical perspective
  - We have inherited the Western stereotype of "the Eastern other" from the Greeks
- Paideia
  - All study of history feeds historical consciousness and helps us better understand our societies
    - The Greeks are a direct view into our past, unlike China or the Maya
  - We return to the Greeks' ideals of exploring ethics honestly, debating policy vigorously, valuing beauty deeply, and acting in a spirit of generosity and civility
    - This is the Greek paideia
  - The Greeks act as a model for who we aim to be and a reminder that flawed societies can still distinguish themselves



## Reading 2: Early Greece and the Minoans: The Labyrinth and the Minotaur

- Greece in the Neolithic: The Origins of Complex Societies
  - Early hominins reached Crete by sea no later than 130,000 years ago
  - Beginning from the Franchthi Cave, evidence of human occupation spreads outwards to the nearby coastal waters
    - Same thing occurs at the Alepotrypa Cave and Dikili Tash
  - Connectedness and the Beginnings of Pottery
    - These societies were able to trade over long distances
    - Sesklo marks the introduction of pottery to the Greek world
    - Communities of Sesklo and Dimini were agro-pastoral
      - People lived by farming and herding, with some parts of their diet supplemented by hunting and gathering
      - Expanding complexity when compared with earlier communities at Franchthi and Deros
      - Existence of walls and a central building called a **megaron** reveal central planning
        - Possible emergence of class distinctions that would later characterize Minoan society
- The Third Millenium: The Bronze Age
  - Growing complexity continues with the adoption of bronze in the 3rd millennium BC + the connectivity of the Aegean world
  - Evidence from the Tsepi cemetery shows the refining process of cupellation and the smelting of lead and silver
  - Impressive construction at Lerna show evidence of labor and centralized authority
    - Existence of a **tumulus** (earthen mound) may be intended to commemorate a powerful chief
  - Evidence of a centrally organized community comes from excavations at Phylokopi, Poliochni, Myrina, Koukonisi, Skarkos
    - Complex buildings and drainage systems in Skarkos + Myrina
  - Keros-Syros culture
    - Used to describe a number of sites in the Cyclades that share the same type of pottery and building design
    - The homogeneity wasn't achieved by peace, possible assertion of power on smaller settlements by larger ones
  - Cycladic figurines
    - Can be dated, function is difficult to identify
    - Most are schematic representations of the female body
    - Dolls? Suggesting of a cult of female fertility? Representative of deities or spirits? Used as part of a ceremony?
  - As the cities grew in size, they grew more stratified
    - The degree of connectivity between them shows a unique connectedness of these cities due to the proximity to water
      - This water encouraged communication of goods/people/ideas
- Minoan Crete
  - Crete's discovery demonstrates there was material that could be connected with the world of Homeric poems
    - Discovered by Heinrich Schliemann
    - Home of the legendary King Minos and the Minotaur
    - Discovery of a civilization that only existed in myth until then
  - Cretan Bronze Age
    - The broadest categories of Minoan chronology concern the development, acme, destruction, and rebuilding of its palaces
      - Similarity between Syrian and Cretan palace design is evidence of Cretan culture participatin gin a wider world of complex, hierarchically organized states
      - The complex displays a theocratic character, leading scholars to suggest that the palaces were ceremonial and ritual centers
      - Similar ground plan of Knossos to other major sites suggest a homogeneous Cretan culture
      - Rooms give impression of a sophisticated and refined elite living in comfort
  - Bull-leaping
    - Performance that acted as a re-enactment of an astronomical story explaining the movement of the stars
    - Bull cult has immense importance
    - Also present in Avaris in Egypt, showing that Cretans participated in a much broader range of cultural relations beyond the Greek mainland/nearby islands
      - In exchange for bringing gifts to the Egyptian pharaoh, it's possible Egyptian-built fleets were used to help Cretans project their power beyond their homeland
    - Bulls were likely sacrificed and venerated
    - Rituals in combination with various features of Cretan palaces are evidence that Minoan society took on an elaborate hieratic character
  - Minoan Religion
    - Despite connections with other areas, Crete was different from the rest of the eastern Mediterranean
      - Do not appear to have been temples to gods
      - Gold rings depicting figures hovering in the air may be suggestive of a moment of epiphany/arrival of divine spirit
      - Speculation that Minoan religion involves rites and practices that result in altered consciousness/spiritual possession
        - Minoan iconography is also suggestive of this - crown of opiates
    - The reality is, we know very little about the beliefs and practices of these people
    - Feasting
      - Significant as a crucial social institution
      - The community is most vividly on display
      - Opportunity for elites to advertise their power
      - Encourages social bonding and can be identified by distinctive ceramic assemblages
      - Carried out as part of funerary rites and religious festivals
      - Gives expression to a rich and complicated social structure
  - Minoan Literature
    - Minoans didn't record liturgical texts, legal documents, or historical chronicles in any semi-permanent forms
    - Did develop a writing system known as Linear A
      - Syllabic and ideographic system employed by scribes
      - Little survives, cannot be translated effectively
      - Second writing system called Linear B
        - Has been successfully translated
        - Disappointing from the view of poetry and literature
        - Useful in understanding the palatial economy
          - The palace was a center of a redistributive economy
    - Minoan Economy
      - Redistributive economy - a complex economic system based on the regular accumulation of surpluses of staple goods
        - Surplus used to support specialized craftsmen and to support farmers in times of crop failure and food shortage
        - Depends on a delicate balance of relations between palace elites and laborers
      - Staple items - oil, grain, wine, etc.
      - Luxury items - precious metals and perfume
      - Manufactured items show that palaces were centers of production and manufacturing
        - Centers of both religion and the economic system
      - Relies on control of the population by the palace
        - Not necessarily exploitative, cooperation leads to success for both sides
        - Receiving from the palace's surplus allows for survival in times of need
        - Giving labor and produce to the palace may have served as a form of devotion to the gods due to the perception of the palace as "home of a god-king"
- Beyond the Palaces
  - No suggestion that palaces controlled all local religious practices
    - Mountain peaks and caves show evidence of sacrifices and dedications pre-dating palaces
  - Settlements popped up without an identifiable center, showing evidence of growth over time, consistent with occupation over multiple generations
    - Remind us that there is a great deal to be learned about the ordinary people
  - Palaces reproduced at a smaller scale also appeared around the countryside, unlikely to be serving directly under the influence of a real palace
  - Various settlements show evidence of serious maritime trade throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean
    - Shipwrecks reveal a great deal about trade and conditions at the time
    - Cargo reveals goods from ports all around the Mediterranean
    - Cabotage relies on the principle that goods increase in value as they become more scarce and exotic
      - Goods may be easy to transport by sea, but will rise in value in locations in which there is no local source of production
- Thera: A Minoan Settlement
  - Akrotiri (known as Thera in antiquity) was a flourishing settlement that may have been founded as a Minoan colony
    - Overlooked the caldera of an active volcano
    - The volcano destroyed the town when it erupted
    - Described as a cosmopolitan merchant harbor
  - Frescoes explore various common motifs
    - Scholars note a possible association with the life cycle
    - May be more than decorative, intended to be read together
  - The Destruction of Thera
    - Impact from the volcanic explosion may have reached Crete, maybe leading to the collapse of the Minoan culture
      - Possibly supported by Greek myth => Atlantis
    - Volcanic disruption may be resulted in destruction of coastal resources and ash may have caused widespread famine and social breakdown
      - The weakened state of Crete created an opening for the Mycenaeans to take control
      - Theory is wrong
        - Marine-style pottery not found on Thera, although others are => suggests Marine-style pottery postdates Thera's destruction
          - Maritime trade patterns shifted, but did not terminate
        - Ash desposits in Pseira fall below buildings that show evidence of continuing civilization
        - Various sources also place the eruption too early to have been the cause for Minoan society's collapse
        - Dates may correspond to the end of the Old Palace period
          - Impact of the eruption may have precipitated a total systems failure, breaking down the economy
          - Elites still would've reasserted older, and a new palatial period would see the recovery of the society
- The End of Minoan Culture
  - General agreement that most Minoan sites, both palatial and lower down the hierarchy of size and complexity, suffered catastrophic destruction that put an end to their complex system
    - This destruction may have spread over a period of 50 years => not a single invasion/uprising
    - The people responded with pastoralism
  - The destruction horizon was primarily caused by the arrival of the Mycenaeans
    - Debate over whether there was an active process of "Mycenaeanization"
- Interpreting the Past
  - Our appreciation of Bronze Age Crete is structured by the work of Arthur Evans



## Reading 3: Mycenae: Rich in Gold

- Schliemann and the Creation of the Bronze Age
  - Schliemann's work at Troy and Mycenae changed the way we saw archaeology and Homer's poems
  - Schliemann's dishonesty creates a cloud of doubt around his discovery
    - Falsification of records, theft, manufacturing of archaeological material, etc.
  - Discoveries at Mycenae have revolutionized the scholarly world's understanding of Homer
    - Proof of a wealthy ruler's fortress matches Homer's description of Agamemnon's home
    - Historians end up using the term "Mycenaean" to describe the entirety of Greek civilization in the Late Bronze Age
    - Schliemann can be said to have given the poems of Homer a tangible materiality
    - Aided by the fact that Mycenae had never disappeared fully from history
    - Also supplied evidence for the place of the Mycenaeans in the larger world of the eastern Mediterranean
- The Origins of the People of the Shaft Graves
  - Mycenaeans were likely a society ruled by a warrior aristocracy
  - Carved scenes resembling carvings found in Egypt connect Mycenae to a world of cultural contact, much like the Minoans
  - Mycenaean culture is difficult to reconstruct - foreign invaders? indigenous?
  - Mycenaean wealth in gold creates another mystery
    - The Argolid (heartland of the Mycenaean world) was not rich in mineral wealth
    - Crete
      - Theory that gold was obtained from conquering the Minoans
      - Gold vessels are more rare on Crete, and stylistically, the 2 civilizations don't share much overlap
    - Egypt
      - Theory that Mycenaean warriors were paid by Egyptian pharaohs for mercenary services
        - Mycenaeans lack a naval presence and the Hyksos' control of the region between Mycenae and Egypt would have made military action difficult
    - Romania
      - Gold mining in Romania as a good for trade
      - Discovery of Aegean goods in Transylvania acts as evidence of a profitable exchange network between southern Greece and the Danube basin
        - Continued expansion into central Europe
        - Mycenaeans were better positioned to take advantage of this trade network than the Minoans
          - Minoan Crete to the south and east in the Mediterranean and Levant
          - Mycenaean Greece towards the north
          - Boundaries would change in the Late Bronze Age
- The Mycenaean World
  - From the middle of the second millennium BC, the Mycenaeans had developed a complex society that controlled much of southern and central Greece
  - Life in the Mycenaean centers
    - Region outside the citadel has revealed evidence of roads, dams ,bridges, and building complexes, demonstrating that Mycenae wasn't a lone, isolated mountain citadel, but the center of an urban environment
    - Specialized trade and manufacturing carried on under the protection of the palace and within the walls of the citadel
    - Discovery of Korphos-Kalamianos shows us that Mycenaean settlements were not always organized around palaces and citadels
      - Possibly associated with the exploitation of pastoral resources in the hinterland
    - Discovery of Pylos shows a lack of fortification walls and a center for redistribution, not unlike Cretan palaces
  - Mycenaean Industry and Labor
    - Major industries included perfume and textile manufacturing
      - High scale of activity
    - We can see that Pylos and other Mycenaean centers participated in the trade network that tied the Aegean into a larger world of commodity exchange
    - Palaces had specialized metalworkers who made silver, gold, and copper vessels and jewelry
      - Personnel also included potters, weavers, dyers, artists, and scribes
    - Tablets also show evidence of the Mycenaean elite and social hierarchy
      - Shows manufacturing as a result of slave labor
      - Tablets show evidence of a surprisingly complex and sophisticated society
        - Many social strata
        - Economic activity occurs on a scale that exceeds the modest palaces and halls described by Homer
    - Archaeological work at Lakonia reveal a palace that would have been a major Mycenaean center of considerable size and power
      - Evidence of large-scale weapons manufacturing
      - If Homeric mythology is to be taken into account, this palace may correspond with the palace of Menelaus and Helen
        - Should understanding of poetry enrich our understanding of archaeology?
  - Linear B: Solving the Riddle
    - There were strong affinities between Mycenaean culture and that of Crete
      - Most readily demonstrated by the presence of Minoan artifacts in Mycenaean burials and domestic settings, suggesting that the Mycenaeans favored Minoan styles
      - Some stylistic differences do separate the two civilizations
      - True connections cannot be answered by archaeology
        - Mycenaeans may have descended from the Cretans or adopted Cretan styles in their society
    - Relations between Mycenae and Crete were strongest in the Linear B tablets discovered in both civilizations
      - Alice Kober establishes the basic syllabic structure of the language and that Linear B was inflected
      - Michael Ventris works off of Kober's work and deciphers the language, showing it was Greek
        - Work shows that the language of the Mycenaeans was Greek and that place names inscribed in Linear B correspond with known toponyms
    - Translation offers no poems or literary texts
      - Invaluable as a source of information about the economic conditions and political organization of the Mycenaean world
        - Ex: evidence of ritual slaughter and feast, which would continue to be the backbone for Greek sacrifice and religious practice for centuries
        - Demonstrate that communities were established between major centers of power, and would communicate with these central authorities
          - Tablets give us a view of a highly organized state apparatus
            - Palace acts as both the symbolic, ritual center, and as the central node in the economic network
            - System based on a balance between the production, storage, and redistribution of staple goods and the manufacturing, trade, and consumption of luxury items
- Mycenaean Knossos
  - After the palaces were destroyed a second time, most palaces were not used as ceremonial or administrative centers
    - Knossos was an exception - it returned to its role as the center of a redistributive economy
  - Use of Linear B at Knossos implies that it was occupied by Greeks, not Cretans
    - Cretans would have used Linear A
    - More evidence that mainland Greeks were the cause of the destruction of the Cretan palaces, likely in an invasion
      - Backed up by evidence of competing power between Minoans and Mycenaeans
      - Backed up by the myth of Theseus => villainizes the Cretans and justifies an invasion of Crete
        - Alteration of the bull cult of the Minoans
      - Discovery of more Linear B tablets suggests an overlap with the Mycenaeans' occupation of Crete and the period of time in which they used Linear B to record economic documents on the mainland
        - Continuity of function of writing suggests a cooperation between Mycenaean elite and their new subjects
      - DNA evidence shows an influx of people from the Peloponnese and central Greece to the Cretan population
  - Mycenaeans would've encountered a social apparatus far more complex and developed than their own
    - Developed a form of state organization and control that clearly mimicked the Cretan model
    - Mycenaeans became the kings of principalities that developed the same model of storage, manufacturing, luxury trade, and redistribution that had been the hallmark of Minoan Crete
- Troy and Homer
  - Bronze Age can also be reconstructed using mythology
    - Most notably, Troy
  - Excavation reveals Troy clearly had many phases of occupation on the same site
    - Time period identifies Homer's Troy as Troy VI or VII
      - Troy VI shows no evidence of collapse due to warfare, therefore most scholars identify Homer's Troy with Troy VII
    - Korfmann claims to have discovered evidence that Troy VI and VII were 10x larger than originally thought
      - Would make Troy one of the larger trade emporia of the Late Bronze Age
      - Location makes it a valuable trade point between the Danubian zone and the Aegean
    - Kolb dismisses Korfmann's interpretation
      - Claims few luxury items from the proposed trade routes
      - No archive has been found associated with the citadel of Troy VI or VII, unlike other great palatial centers
      - Most scholars agree with Korfmann
    - Hittite correspondence suggests that many elements of Homer's poems derive from the conditions at the end of the Bronze Age
      - Question for historians is what aspects of the poems reflect historical reality and what elements are fiction?
      - Poems initially passed down orally means there is a large gap between the events they describe and when the poems were finally written down
        - Especially impossible to describe social institutions and abstractions accurately
        - Governmental practices are likely to be associated with the poet's own time
        - Specific descriptions that delighted the audience were likely to be retained
  - Likely that Troy was sacked and, due to the upheavals of the time, the Mycenaeans were involved
    - Would've been because of the wealth of the strategically located city
    - The absence of the Hittites, which would've been a large power at the time of the Mycenaeans, leads to the belief that Homer's accounts of the Trojan War do not accurately describe history
- The Collapse of Mycenaean Culture
  - Following Homer's poems, the fall of Troy would've signified the beginning of the end of the Bronze Age
  - Major Mycenaean sites collapsed along a horizon of destruction, similar to the earlier case of Minoan Crete
    - Climate change creates a collapse of the Mycenaean economy
    - Evidence of foreign invasion
    - Changes in battle technology, leading to a shift from chariot-based combat to infantry combat, resulting in chariot-based forces of Mycenaean elites losing their grip on power
      - All explanations may have played some role
  - As disasters hit Mycenaean power centers, construction projects and Linear B tablets imply potential threat of siege from the sea
    - Fear not unwarranted due to the presence of a loose coalition of tribes that exploited tensions between the great eastern Mediterranean states to plunder, known as the Sea People



## Reading 4: The Iron Age

- Center and Periphery in the Early Iron Age
  - Homer's poems recast the Bronze Age into a world of heroes
    - The world described in Homeric poems is much closer to the Early Iron Age rather than the time of Minoan Crete and the Mycenaeans
    - An example of Homer's halls exists at Lefkandi on the island of Euboia
      - Illustrative of how a society ruled by chieftians was emerging in the Proto-Geometric period
      - Shortly after its construction, it was used in burial rituals, a practice resembling the Mycenaean world
      - Has forced scholars to re-examine the Greek world after the collapse of the Mycenaeans
        - Previously assumed that the Greek world had returned to a world dominated by poor farmers and herders
        - Palaces did cease to function, but the aftermath was contained
        - Recent excavations have shown a continuity of settlement from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age
    - The people of Iron Age Greece actively created memories of their past (Trojan War) and recast those stories with heroes with similar values to the Greek rulers of the Iron Age
      - Bronze Age tombs were also revisited and venerated in late periods
        - Tombs acted as a connection to a heroic past
    - Homeric poems shaped the Iron Age by connecting the present and heroic past in narrative
  - Society and Identity in the Iron Age
    - Descendants of the hero of Lefkandi participated in a Mediterranean trade network
      - Shows evidence that within 100 years of the end of the palaces, the eastern periphery of the Mycenaean world had recovered
      - Palaces weren't restored, a new form of social organization would develop
    - The oikos or household was a patrilinear family unit centered on the big man
      - The men styled themselves as rulers
      - Homeric poems were shaped by the highly competitive society they dominated
        - Hieratic states and redistributive economies of the Bronze Age make little impact on Homer's stories
        - We rely on Homeric poems to reconstruct the social world of this big man society, supplemented by material culture
      - Clear signs of communal organization can be found in Early Iron Age communities
    - At some settlements, multiple hamlets appear to have existed in close proximity to one another
      - Points to competing clans, each dominated by a chieftain
      - Scholars see this society as comprised of a warrior elite controlling large numbers of dependent farmers
        - Weapons and figurines of warriors dating back to this period are common
          - Warrior figurine from Karditsa
    - Terracotta figurine from the Toumba cemetery has been suggested to represent Cheiron, a centaur who raised Achilles
      - Insuifficient evidence, but acts as a reminder that the period was richly imaginative
      - Monsters and hybrids of Greek myth were definitely present during the Iron Age
        - Centaurs located on the edge of the Mycenaean world
        - With Mycenaean Greece long gone, the south would still be associated with advanced civilization, while the north was tied to wildness
    - Mykonos pithos depicting the Trojan Horse
      - Reminds us that the stories told in the epic cycle remained alive in the imagination of the Greeks for hundreds of years, despite the historical events they depicted having occurred long ago
      - Points to the importance of Homer's stories
        - Also reflected by "Nestor's cup" found at the Greek colony of Pithekoussai
    - The Iron Age saw its own significant cultural developments
      - Production of monumental funerary markers in Athens
        - Vessels were comprised of the ekphora, the procession that escorted the body to the burial, and the prothesis, a depiction of the body laid out, with others engaging in lamentations around the corpse
        - Opportunity for great families to assert their status
    - Shift from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age
      - Widespread upheavals in the eastern Mediterranean around 1150 BC
        - May have jeopardized the regular international trade
        - Centralized control broke down in palatial centers
        - Linear B lost forever, and Greece would remain without a writing system for 300 years
        - Reliance on oral poetry to link to the past and blend with the new Iron Age
      - Iron Age was a society ruled by elites who participated in international trade
        - Possible monopolization of iron, the new preferred material for weapons
      - New social order would develop, based on the domination of a warrior elite who modeled themselves on Homer's heroes
      - Greek culture would be introduced to new challenges, but Homer would still give the Greeks their identity
  - Heroes and Villains
    - The Early Iron Age saw memories of a heroic past shape the present
      - Basileis asserted their status as leaders and warriors
      - Families and households fashioned elite identities by practicing tomb and ancestor cult
      - Homeric poems expressed a complex attitude towards the past
    - The Nostoi told of the returns of the heroes of Troy
      - Tales of shipwreck, betrayal, and death
      - Odysseus' homecoming contrasted with that of Agamemnon, who returned and was killed by Klytaimnsetra and Aigisthos
      - Emphasizes that, despite the use of the epic poems' by princes to claim heroic descent, they were often expressive of a society dissatisfied with the rule of kings
      - Rudimentary depictions of justice and governance; concern with the operation of authority
        - Reflected in the work of eighth-century poet, Hesiod
        - "The strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must"
    - Poems often leave the audience aware of how inadequate the Homeric code is as the basis of a social contract
      - Odysseus' return home involved the slaughter of the Suitors and the hanging of the servant girls => continuation of the cycle of violence
      - Despite the magnificence of Homeric heroism on the battlefield, it threatened to condemn Iron Age society to eternal warfare
        - Can the code that nurtures warriors be reconciled with peace?
- Polis and Ethnos in the Eighth Century
  - During the 8th century, the polis/city-state emerged as the distinctive form of Greek social and political life
    - Developments contributed to the culture of Archaic Greece
      - Age of the first Olympics
      - Age of the first overseas trade emporia
      - Beginning of a diaspora of Greeks throughout the Mediterranean and beyond
      - Age of the first acquisition of the Greek alphabet
  - The rise of the city-state
    - Evidence at old Smyrna and Corinth, where clusters of houses and specialized production areas suggest the growth of complex social organization
      - Cluster of villages around the later agora/marketplace witnessed a rapid increase in population
      - Corinthian pottery began to be traded far afield, suggesting a vigorous commercial life tied to the community
      - Profited from its position at the intersection of the Corinthian and Saronic Gulfs, allowing for the easy export of material both east and west
      - Colonies dispatched from Corinth by members of the same family, suggestive of oligarchic control by the Bacchiads
    - The polis was not the sole form of social organization to emerge from the Iron Age
      - Aggregates of communities asserted a common ethnic identity, known as ethne
        - Many of these formed political federations known as koina
        - Ex: the Aitolians of western Greece all claimed to be descendants of Aitolos
        - Varied from identifying as primarily religious networks to important regional organizations
  - Monumental Temples and the Rule of Law
    - Closely connected with the increase in urban agglomerations
    - Attest to the importance of religious and cult activity in the eighth and seventh centuries
      - Many Early Archaic sanctuaries were the result of transforming the houses of rulers and the elite into temples of the gods
    - In the 6th century BC, the Greeks would go on to begin building temples out of limestone and marble
      - Scholars note the evolutionary development in temple architecture
      - Represents a fundamental shift in the nature of social hierarchy
    - As gods emerged as the central focus of these communities, kings declined in importance
      - Communities took first steps towards establishing regular, codified laws
      - Governance shifted from the basileis to the sovereign decisions of the community
      - At Dreros we see the establishment of legal authority in the community
        - Executive power would rotate and boards of magistrates guaranteed that power wouldn't fall in the hands of a single individual
        - Shift away from the world of kings and Homeric heroes
    - Early Greek lawgivers' stories follow formulaic patterns involving an initial crisis, the appointment of the lawgiver, testing of new laws, and the departure of the lawgiver
      - Seems to suggest that the establishing of laws with the help of the gods or a semi-divine lawgiver was a stage of development that societies needed to endure to survive
    - Early Greek law was primarily procedural, not substantive
      - Laws dictated how an arbitration was to be conducted or what penalty to serve
      - Didn't detail any underlying principles
      - Practical, not theoretical
    - Writing down of laws altered the way they operated
      - People who know laws and expounded on them lost importance
      - Placed emphasis on the law, not the legal expert
      - Regarded as a step towards democracy
- A Greek Diaspora
  - Vigorous commercial activity throughout the Greek world between 750 - 500 BCE
    - Trading north as far as Ukraine
    - Trading south as far as Egypt
    - Eventually established permanent colonies in trade destinations
      - Done as a result of population growth pressure at home, resulting in a need for new land?
      - Done to acquire trade opportunities, giving rise to the foundation of colonies?
    - What general conditions led to the Greeks leaving their ancestral home?
  - Some places dedicated to trade represent the mercantile drive that took Greeks to the farthest reaches of the Mediterranean world
    - Evidence of land divisions at these sites imply that land was a valuable resource for settlers at the time
      - Land was surveyed and plots of equal size were apportioned to the first settlers
    - Colonists may have been dispatched by some mother-city, but these colonies were founded by waves of settlers
    - Trade and land went hand in hand
    - Agricultural colonies cannot be classified separately from trading colonies
    - Colonies in the region known as Magna Graecia have been surveyed, showing that most of them were planned from the outset
      - Desire to honor the gods, setting aside areas for worship
      - Need to provide land for new settlers
        - Allocation raises questions of status and fairness => settlers needed to have equal portions of land
        - Division into lots (kleroi) of plethra => small plots, evidence that settlers planned on supplementing survival with land holdings out of town and trade
    - Central area set aside to house the temples of the gods and an agora (public space)
      - Roads ran out from this central area, dividing land into equal plots
      - Orientation of buildings shows initial planning, unlike the organic communities of the mainland
  - Communities, Foundations, and Identities
    - Colonies confirmed the authority of a founder and lawgiver, resembling Zeus, but also helped articulate a notion of equality
    - Debate that the idea of formal colonial expeditions sent from the mother-city (metropolis) is a retrojection from later times to provide legitimacy to the colonies' founding
      - Intertwining of myth and history
      - The founding of Cyrene has multiple  different variations, scattered across Greece
      - These stories create affinities based on goodwill, fictional ties of blood, and shared episodes in the tales
        - Narrative linked communities across the Aegean world
    - Greeks forced to ask and answer the basic questions of social life
      - What constitutes a community?
      - How shall it be governed?
      - What authority will give its laws force?
      - How shall we live?
  - Delphi and Greek Identity
    - The story of Cyrene's founding points to the central role of Delphi
    - Accounts of colonial foundations commonly feature natural disasters, brought upon the subjects of the stories by the oracle in response to some wrongdoing
      - Communities of Archaic Greece were compelled to seek the active guidance of the oracle for help on these matters
      - Centers on Apollo, the god of oracular communication and who led many colonial expeditions to their new home
    - Apollo's authority is used to give legitimacy to Cyrene and many other colonies
      - His presence is found in lawmaking as well
    - Apollo's involvement in every aspect of the Greek diaspora shaped the community's Greek identity
      - Mentality of "us" and "them"
      - Mention of the indigenous people prior to Greek settlement is rare
        - They were demonized, projected into the Greek imagination as monsters
        - Indication of this is present in art and temples
        - Giants, amazons, and hybrid monsters served as a reminder of the dangers and threats lurking on the borders of the known world
        - Promotion of constant hostility towards others
- "Orientalizing" and Eastern Influence
  - Ideas and motifs from the eastern Mediterranean entered Greek culture during the Orientalizing phase
    - Greek response to this new cultural interaction shown by exotic animals and strange hybrids on Corinthian pottery
  - These new ideas and motifs were used to help define a sense of Greekness
    - They also materially changed the nature of Greek culture itself
    - Greeks absorbed the stories, poems, and technologies of the eastern people
      - This is especially shown when contrasting Hesiod's poetry with Homer's
        - Story of Ouranos/Kronos/Zeus resembles Hurrian and Hittite poems
        - Story of Zeus and Typhoeus resembles the Babylonian story of Marduk and Tiamat
  - Near East stories place the rivalries of various kingdoms and city-states of the ancient Near-East into narrative form
    - They also draw on deeply rooted psychological fears
    - Many draw from astrological significance and the constellations
  - The mixing of stories with the Near East also influenced by the adoption of an Eastern alphabet and the reinvention of writing in the Greek world
  - The Reinvention of Writing
    - Linear B fell out of use with the fall of palatial culture and the end of the Bronze Age
      - It remained absent from the Greek world for 300+ years afterwards
      - Since Linear B was used to monitor the economic system of palaces, the downfall of that economic system resulted in the downfall of the script
    - In 720 BCE, the Greeks adopted a writing system from the northwest Semitic Phoenicians
      - Earliest written Greek turns up where Greeks and Phoenicians traded, adapted to ease the exchange of goods
      - Possible that bilingual children of marriages between Greeks and Phoenicians would have adopted the script of one language to represent the sounds of the other
      - Practice caught on very quickly
    - Writing's widespread use has been underscored by excavations at Methone
      - Dozens of vessels inscribed with Greek names and lines of verse found in the Ypogeio (Underground)
        - Vessels included both transport vessels and drinking cups
      - Provenance of the material attests to the importance of Methone
        - Profited from its strategic location => interior rich in timber, metal reserves from Macedonia, point of entry to Aegean trade network, etc.
      - Among the earlies pieces of written Greek
      - Some cases used to label transport vessels, in other cases, it's used to identify the owner of the drink
        - Use in trade and in the symposium
        - Would later be used to write down the Homeric poems
      - Reveals a Greek culture tightly bound into Aegean and Mediterranean worlds characterized by intense degrees of interaction
      - Cultural exchange between Greeks and non-Greeks
- The Olympics
  - The diaspora is accompanied by an opposite movement towards asserting Greek identity
    - Found expression through the cultural institution of the Olympics
  - Founded in 776 BC by Herakles
  - For 1000+ years, it would remain one of the key institutions for determining inclusion within the community of Greeks
    - By extension, it determined exclusion for those that weren't Greek
  - Held every 4 years at the foot of Kronos Hill, adjacent to the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia
    - Region is far from the direct control of any major power
  - Initially dominated by Spartans
    - They didn't attempt to take control of the sanctuary
    - Emerged as a panhellenic sanctuary, where Greeks from anywhere could mix freely
    - Critical in the shaping and emergence of Greek identity
  - Competitors reinforced their common Greek identity by competing with one another
    - Only Greeks competed with Greeks
    - Reinforced by shared culture, shared language, and shared myths
  - The Olympics were a sacred event, conducted for the glory of Zeus as much as it was for the glory of the athletes
    - Month leading up to the games was a time of truce throughout Greece (ekecheiria), during which wars were suspended
  - Core events remained fundamental over the Olympics' years of existence
    - Stadion - straight sprint the length of the stadium
    - Diaulos - sprint to the end and back
    - Dolichos - long distance race of 20 stadia
    - Included a series of combat competitions: boxing, wrestling, pankration
    - Pentathlon - discus, javelin, standing jump, running, and wrestling
  - Early in its existence, there was a strong association between aristocratic status and Olympic victory
    - Many victors were dynastic rulers on the mainland, with their Olympic wins bound up with claims to legitimacy in their families
    - Pindar's poems cast these Olympic victors as Homeric heroes
    - Victory is a confirmation of arete (virtue or excellence), affirming and extending the family's nobility
    - Reward for victory is kleos aphthiton (undying fame), the same thing sought after by Homeric heroes
    - Possible that the Olympics began as a way for aristocrats to demonstrate their prowess and to assert the claim that they embodied the virtues found in Homer's poems
  - Over time, the aristocratic character of the games disappeared and professional athletes emerged
    - Rewards became material, like cash or food
    - These professional athletes still exerted enormous influence in their communities
      - Served as political and military leaders and worshipped as demigods after their deaths
    - They were honored for their accomplishments and revered for their powers



## Reading 5: The Archaic Age: Sparta

- The Archaic Period (c. 700 - 480 BCE) was one of increasing prosperity, but also rising tension
- Archaic Crisis: Wealth, Strife, and Tyranny
  - Greeks experienced long and sustained contact with other cultures
    - Goods and ideas coming into Greece
    - Greeks establishing themselves around the Mediterranean
    - This penetration of culture would become profound in the Archaic Age
  - Greeks experience an increase in trade in the search for resources, land, and luxury items
    - To the Greeks, the wider Mediterranean world was a place of communities connected by trade, commerce, and the establishment of colonies, but also a world of wonders, threats, and anxieties brought about by contact with others
      - Represented by the widespread use of monsters in Greek mythology at the time
      - Touched on by the *Odyssey*
  - Contact with the wider world prompted important changes on the mainland
    - City-states were growing larger and regional powers (Athens, Thebes, and Sparta) began to emerge
    - Wealth, status, competition, and rivalry (aristocratic and between communities) become more prevelant
  - Corinth
    - Located on a narrow isthmus that separated the Saronic Gulf and Corinthian Gulf
      - Possessed a well-fortified acropolis above the city
      - Two separate harbors from east to west that allowed for large amounts of wealth to flow through the city
    - In the early Archaic Period, Corinth was under the control of the Bacchiads
      - Supplied kings (later annual magistrates) and colonial leaders who founded new colonies
    - In the mid-7th century BCE, Kypselos seized power and ruled as a tyrant
      - This pattern repeated in many parts of Greece, where tyrants used the social and political tensions of the age to seize control of their communities
      - This trend was originally seen as a symptom of the disorder and weakness of the early city-states due to the negative connotations associated with tyranny
        - In reality, many of these tyrants acted as lawgivers and had relatively benign rules
        - This may have even helped put an end to regional factionalism
        - Provided a generation of stability that freed the city-states from social upheaval and increased economic prosperity
      - Attests to the political upheavals affecting many Greek city-states in the Archaic period
  - Poetry on stasis (internal civil conflict)
    - In many communities, we hear of men killed or exiled due to factional disputes within the emerging city-states
    - Archaic period classified as one where more and more people were subject to the compulsions of a few, leading to class struggles
      - Point to the fact that men called the aristoi, which formed the elite class, can now be identified in poetry
      - We also hear of subject groups (the penestai of Thessaly, klarotai in Crete, and helots in Sparta)
    - Actual evidence of civil disorder points to it stemming from competing groups of aristocrats, clans not classes
      - Lesbos, Halikarnassos, Megara, etc.
      - Vertical vs. horizontal divisions
  - Euboia
    - Commerce flourished, leading to the success of Chalkis and Eretria
    - Increased prosperity led to competition between the neighboring communities
    - The Battle of the Lelantine Plain was fought between the two citiees
      - Remembered as one of the epochal events of the Archaic period
      - For the next 400 years, Greek interstate relations would be comprised of a continuous series of wars
        - May be due to the deep-seated heroic values of epic, leading to an inability to develop loyalty to any group beyond the immediate family/clan/community
  - The establishment of a Greek colony in Egypt brought the art of stone-cutting and sculpting to Greek culture
  - Emergence of a monetized economy
    - Coins made it possible for trade to bypass the process of barter => goods no longer needed to be exchanged directly
    - Greek accounts attribute the creation of coinage to Pheidon of Argos
    - This shift threatened to replace aristocratic birth with monetary wealth as the highest good to which an individual could aspire
      - Money and heroism at odds
- Early Sparta
  - Throughout the history of Sparta, the citizens have been strongly hostile towards tyrants (misotyrannos)
    - Claim that their political and communal life was based on eunomia (good order), which can be attributed to the lawgiver Lykourgos
    - Sparta followed a vastly different trajectory to other Greek communities when it came to their social and political contract
    - Spartans emphasized a strict social hierarchy, topped by the warrior class known as the Spartiates
  - Geography played a role in Sparta's unique social organization
    - Cut off from neighboring lands by mountains, leading to a sense of physical isolation that allowed Sparta to avoid the stasis of other communities
    - Spartans applied themselves to a strict and unyielding code of conduct that was designed to raise generations of warriors
  - Difficult for historians to separate the actual history of Sparta with the mythologization of its traditions
    - "The Spartan Mirage"
    - Terse in speech, stand in battle until the end, prized honor over life, and trained under the harshest conditions
    - Use the material culture of the region to shed light on its early history
      - Palace at Aghios Vasileios proved that the region of Lakonia was integrated into the Mycenaean world
        - Further evidence implies that the culture of Bronze Age Lakonia resembles the Bronze Age culture of other regions during the time of the Mycenaeans
      - After the Bronze Age, Lakonia was affected by the same changes that led to the fall of other Mycenaean centers
        - Spartan tradition associates these upheavals with the return of the Herakleidai, the descendants of Herakles
        - Historians choose to see this as evidence of societies in transition
      - The society that would shape in Sparta looked very different than in other regions
        - Unification of Athens leads to a fully developed city center, but civic buildings/city center in Sparta are hard to identify
        - The physical grandeur of Athens leads people to overestimate its power, while the opposite was true of Sparta
  - Spartan Religion
    - At Amyklai, the Spartans engaged in the worship of a hero, Hyakinthos, and the god Apollo
      - Pairing of hero and god wasn't unique, but the monument built in honor of them was extraordinary
    - Helen of Troy
      - Athenian depictions of Helen were highly negative, while she was honored as a heroine and goddess in Sparta
      - She received sacrifices and dedications at the Menelaion
    - The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia
      - More than 100,000 lead figurines have been found here, depicting hoplites, female worshippers, and animals
        - Probably dedications to the goddess in recognition of her help
      - Terracotta masks that portray grotesque faces representing demons
      - Goddess looks not unlike Phoenician goddesses, possibly pointing to early connections between Sparta and the East
        - Some scholars point to this as evidence that the cult of Artemis Orthia was brought to Sparta by Phoenicians
        - Material evidence points to a connection with workshops on Crete
      - Ritual where boys were charged with stealing large wheels of cheese from the altar while being savagely whipped
        - Belief that the blood they shed would appease the goddess
    - Temple architecture
      - Most Greek temples were peripteral, meaning the central chamber was surrounded by an external colonnade of columns
      - Lakonian temples were non-peripteral, appearing simpler and less ornamental
    - Spartan practice represents a variation on norms found throughout the Greek world
      - Even Greeks believed that Sparta was distinctive
      - Possible that the panhellenic view of Greece that has come from the Homeric poems obscures the true degree of local variation in Greek culture and religion
- Spartan Exceptionalism
  - Possible that a series of wars with the Messenians led to the Spartans taking a diverging path to building their society
    - Foundation of the Spartan colony of Taras at Tarentum around 700 BCE
      - Tradition claims that this colony was founded by the Parthenioi, men who were born to Spartan women while their husbands were away at the Messenian wars
        - Questionable legitimacy and status resulted in them being deported to a new colony
      - Helps us track down the time period of the Messenian wars
    - Second Messenian War proved to be a turning point for Sparta's internal development
      - Having defeated the Messenians, the Spartans decided to permanently subjugate them, treating them as a servile class in their own territory
        - Throughout the rest of Greek history, the conflict between two warring units would essentially end when the campaigning season of the war came to an end
      - Spartans annexed the territory to Lakonia
        - Land was worked by the slaves of Sparta (helots), a population which included Messenia's original owners
        - Transformed Messenia and made it possible/necessary for Sparta to become a society dedicated to the raising of elite warriors
        - Ever-present threat of a helot uprising
        - Every institution of Spartan society was directed towards the creation of a warrior-elite, whose existence depended on the continued subjugation of the helots
  - Spartiate training
    - Spartan boys taken from their families at the age of seven and raised with other boys their own age
      - Age-class system called the agoge
      - Boys encouraged to steal, live by their wits, and resist weakness

        - Reform actually established to make political life predictable and orderly
          - In the long term, it would make the rule of law secure and help with the institution of a stable democracy
      - Banned the export of grain from Attica
        - Determined that self-sufficiency is desirable
      - Attempted to encourage a diversity of skills in the community, offering citizen ship to foreign craftsmen who came to Athens

- Stasis and Tyranny after Solon
  - While Solon laid the foundation for Athenian prosperity in later years, the immediate aftermath of his rule didn't reflect this
    - Twice in decade following Solon's archonship, no archon was elected, resulting in Athens leaning towards tyranny
    - Damasias elected archon in 582 BCE, but refused to leave office until driven out
    - Threat facing Athens identified as a form of class warfare, where the poor subsistence farmers chafed against the oppressive rule of the wealthiest landowners

  - In 561 BCE, Peisistratos made the first of a series of attempts to establish himself as tyrant of Athens
    - Herodotus maintains that Athens was riven by strife between factional groups (Megakles and the coast, Lykourgos and the plains, and Peisistratos)
    - Would eventually defeat his enemies at the Battle of Pallene, asserting himself as tyrant
  - The Legacy of Peisistratos
    - In later times, the Athenians would venerate the men who liberated Athens from the tyrants
    - Peisistratos' rule was actually fair
      - Maintained laws and held elections every year, enhancing the regularity and predictability necessary for prosperous development

    - Expansion of festivals such as the Dionysia and Panathenaia
      - The Panathenaia helped foster a growing sense of Athenian identity
        - "All-Athens" celebration commemorating Athena's victory over the Giants

      - After the expulsion of the tyrants, the Athenians would celebrate the deeds of the "Tyrant Slayers": Harmodios and Aristogeiton
    - Notion that the tyrannicides liberated an Athens ruled oppressively by the Peisistratids is an oversimplification
      - The Alkmaeonids and other noble families tried to distance themselves from the tyrants in the waning years of Hippias' reign
      - Evidence of collaboration and cooperation between the great aristocratic families and the tyrants
        - Heads of leading families held archonships during the time of tyrant reign
- Kleisthenes and the Foundation of Democracy
  - The removal of Hippias resulted in the reemergence of regional, aristocratic factions and the clan-based political violence from the pre-Solon times

    - Proposes a comprehensive and systematic reform of the Athenian tribal and electoral system
    - Redrew the electoral map of Attica, splitting the old regional power-clusters
      - Fixes every Athenian male citizen to the deme where he was born
      - A cluster of demes comprised a trittys, which, when combined such that there was one trittyes from the coast, one from the city, and one from the plains, made up one of 10 tribes
  - Tribes were fundamental to the political and military life of Athens
    - The Council of Five Hundred contained 50 members from each tribe and oversaw the day-to-day running of the state
    - System and its institutions endured long into the following periods
    - System's purpose has been long debated
      - Gerrymandering by Kleisthenes to place Alkmaionid influence across multiple tribes?
      - Helps with long-term military readiness?
    - Reforms directly addressed the problems of local and regional rivalries
      - Makes it harder for aristocratic families to organize block votes of their dependents
      - Demes voted in different tribal assemblies, making controlling local demes' votes impossible
      - Weakens ties between powerful clans and their neighbors
    - Tribe members participated in military and other various tribal activities with demes they otherwise would've had no association with
      - Leads to a strengthened collective identity at the level of the polis
  - Isagoras reported to have called upon the Spartans to remove Kleisthenes, dismantle his system, and disband the Council of Five Hundred
    - Athenians would rise up against the Spartan king Kleomenes, and would eventually force the Spartans and Isagoras to leave
  - Ostracism
    - A process by which the Athenians would expel a leading figure for 10 years
      - The man wouldn't lose citizenship or property
      - Designed to identify would-be tyrants and stop them
      - Long process in order to avoid impetuous decisions
      - Not resorted to every year => points to Athenians only using this process when there was a great deal of apprehension about an individual
        - Cases where the process was used point to the demos being aware of the sort of men whose ambitions had caused unrest in the previous century
    - Shows the democracy using a similar process that tyrants would have used against challengers to their power

  - Victory of the Greeks had positives and negatives
    - Victory gave the Greeks enormous self-confidence
      - Architectural works like the Parthenon, composing of plays like the Medea
    - Transformed this victory in to an instance of triumphalism, a moderately racist celebration of all things Greek and demonization of all things foreign

    - Network of well-maintained roads stretched across the empire
      - Facilitated communication between the Great King and the satraps located on the peripheries of the empire
      - Overland communication across ancient Persia likely as fast as any other pre-Industrial Revolution
    - Official position regarding this vast territory was that it was a domain made up of distinct nationalities and ethnic groups who paid tribute in orderly fashion to the royal authority that bound the empire together
      - Society with agrarian/nomadic roots successfully adopted the habits of a large, complex, sedentary, bureaucratically organize, hierarchal states of the ancient Near East

    - One bright spot: use of silver by Themistokles to build a new fleet of triremes, providing naval backing to the Greek forces
  - Thermopylae
    - Greeks retreated from Tempe to Thermopylae

    - Leonidas and a force of various Greeks stayed to use the narrow terrain to nullify the Persians' number advantage
      - Worked for multiple days, surviving an onslaught of the Immortals
      - Betrayed by Ephialtes, who informed the Persians of a pass, allowing them to flank and surround the Greeks, leading to their defeat
    - The soldiers of Thermopylae had won undying glory, like heroes of Homeric epic, according to Herodotus
    - Difficult to separate myth from reality
      - Was Thermopylae even a strategic defense point?
      - What did King Leonidas hope to accomplish?
  - Salamis
    - Persian navy engages the Athenians in the Battle of Artemision
      - Indecisive, with the Greeks withdrawing to the Saronic Gulf
      - Athens is evacuated, with the men reporting to the ships
        - Athens burned down by the Persian army
        - Due to Themistokles' interpretation of the "Wooden Wall", given by the Delphic oracle
    - Athenian navy assembles at Salamis
      - Leonidas is to Thermopylae as Themistokles is to Salamis
      - Athenians have bigger ships, but are outnumbered
      - Themistokles pushed for an engagement in a narrow space
      - Greeks open attack, and the discipline of the Greek ships proved superior
        - Better tactics and more experience
      - Greater numbers of Persian ships hindered maneuverability and caused confusion
      - Persians decisively defeated, resulting in Xerxes and his land army retreating from Attica
  - Plataia
    - Persians come back after the winter
    - More states had fallen into the hands of the Persians and medized, most notably Thebes
    - Conflict over how to approach the Persian threat
      - Desire to remain behind the wall at the Isthmus, but that meant abandoning Attica, which was against Athenian interests
    - Common Greek identity being shaped by the shared danger they faced
    - Greek forces assemble at Plataia, where the advantage lay with the Persians
      - Persians led by Mardonios, who took advantage of the Greeks' supply line issues
      - Greeks end up killing Mardonios and routing the Persians
      - Athenians prevailed in an almost-separate encounter with the Thebans
- Aftermath of the Persian Wars
  - Herodotus' account reflects the traditions and stories that grew up in the generation after the Persian War, when everyone wanted credit
  - Victory's impact can be seen in Aischylos' play Persians
    - Greeks quickly came to see themselves as on par with the Persians
    - Desire to assert that Athenians were most directly responsible for the victory
    - Greeks see freedom as a marker of the Greeks' separate political communities
  - The "barbarian" becomes inferior to the Greek
  - Increasingly xenophobic attitude towards the East
  - Corresponds to the epoch of the greatest cultural accomplishment achieved by the Greeks



## Reading 8: Democracy and Empire

- Pentekontaetia - fifty year period
  - Deals with the recovery of Athens from the utter destruction of the Persian War until the end of the 5th century BCE, when Athens was at its height
  - Story of influential statesmen like Kimon and Perikles
  - Sparta would come to replace Persia as the focus of Athenian hostility
- Athenian life in the Classical Age
  - Democracy more firmly established as a result of reforms designed to maximize number of citizen participants
    - Assembly, council, magistracies, and law courts
    - Great lengths to diffuse power broadly across many sectors of society
      - Random selection, rotation of office, and annuality guarantee a widely egalitarian ethos
  - Athens assumes the role of hegemon of an alliance of Greek states eager to continue the war with Persia
    - Causes Athens to emerge as an imperial power
    - Creation of an increasingly coercive system of hegemony abroad, focusing on on garrisons, military governors, the exaction of tribute, and the brutal suppression of dissent and revolt
  - Tension between democracy and empire
- Introduction: From Ruin to Recovery
  - Greeks immediately undertook a campaign against the Great King for the ravages perpetrated by the Persians after Plataia
    - Despite defeat, Xerxes and his dynasty would rule Persian until they were taken over by Alexander the Great
    - Campaigned in the Hellespont region, assaulting Persian islands and coastal cities
    - Spartan victor at Plataia (Pausanias) would be discredited due to rumors that he began behaving like a tyrant after assuming control of greek forces
      - Exhibited tendency towards violence and coercion
      - Began to resemble the Persian king whose army he defeated
      - Results in Ionians imploring Athens to take command of the allied forces
      - Pausanias recalled to Sparta and eventually found guilty of conspiring with the Persians, sentencing him to death by starvation
      - Spartans' desire to stay away from foreign affairs leaves control of the Greek forces virtually uncontested for Athens
  - New alliance of Greek states formed: The Delian League
    - Athenians elect treasurers, called Hellenotamiai, to assess the allies' tributes
      - Tributes intended to pay for the campaign in which the Athenians and the allies would take revenge for the sufferings the Persians had inflicted upon them
      - In reality, tributes handed the Athenians subjects, ships, revenues, and justification for open-ended military operation
    - Immediately began a vigorous campaign to rid the Aegean of Persian presence
    - Quickly became noticeable that the Athenian leadership, led by Kimon, focused on asserting Athenian interests
      - First target of the Persian garrison at Eion included the enslavement of the entire population
        - Gave Athens access to the gold and silver of Mount Pangaion and the timber of the Macedonian hills for shipbuilding
        - Quarrel arises between Athens and Thasos over the markets and mineral resources of the region => results in Athens defeating Thasos and claiming their resources
      - Seized the island of Skyros and enslaved its population
        - No strategic significance in relation to the Persian campaign, but was pivotal to the route by which Athens obtained grain
        - Evidence of Athens' quick realization of their naval supremacy
        - Religious pretext that Theseus had died on the island
      - Overwhelmed the people of Karystos (also on the grain route) and forced the city to join the Delian League
        - Placed a cleruchy (colony) here later
      - Put down a revolt by the island of Naxos, who sought to leave the Delian League
    - In its first decade of existence, the Delian League was little more than an instrument of Athenian policy
    - By the Battle of Eurymedon, the Delian League had been transformed into an Athenian naval empire
- Democratic Institutions
  - Athens had survived the Persian Wars with the institutions of democracy intact
  - The Ekklesia and Archonship
    - Sovereign power lay with the demos
    - When the citizen body met collectively, the Ekklesia did as well
      - Each month, one of four meetings was designated the Kyria Ekklesia, where matters of particular importance (war, foreign proposals, allied tributes etc.) were discussed
      - Ordinary citizens heard reports from officials on all sorts of civic matters
      - Agenda prepared by the Boule
      - The proedroi (executive group of nine men) watched over the proceedings
        - Membership rotated with each meeting
      - Anyone present was entitled to speak
      - Participation open to any Athenian citizen who had completed their military training
    - Democratic system of Kleisthenes functioned throughout the Classical period, but was subjected to some changes
      - While it was originally allowed for Athenian citizens to have an Athenian father and non-Athenian mother, this was changed so that a citizen must have an Athenian mother and father
        - Change designed to ensure exclusivity of Athenian citizenship?
        - Change designed as an attack by Perikles at Kimon (who was of mixed heritage) and other aristocrats?
    - Democratic system also depended on various boards of magistrates to supervise the affairs of the city
      - The three archons => "Rulers" of Athens
        - One in charge of the army => Polemarch or War-Archon
        - One acted as chief priest and conducted sacrifices on behalf of the community => Archon Basileus or King Archon
        - The head of state => Eponymous Archon
      - Archon system lasted for centuries, but the system was changing along the way
        - Originally, archons were chosen from men from Solon's top two social classes
          - Changed so that archons were randomly selected from an eligible pool (klerosis ek prokriton)
          - Later opened up to men from the third social class, making the archonship more democratic and egalitarian
        - After the archon was opened up to more Athenians, the misthos (payment for service on juries) was introduced
          - Funded by a state fund called the dikastikon
          - Phenomenon of payment for service reflects a broader appreciation of democratic practice, also seems to have arisen as a result of the rivalry between Kimon and Perikles
          - The theorikon was a similar state fund that granted poor citizens tickets to major religious festivals
          - Debate over whether these funds were a form of bribery for the masses or proof that democratic institutions were evolving to give more men a greater investment in civic life
  - The Boule and the Areopagus
    - The Boule was the most important of Kleisthenes' institutions for the day-to-day running of the state
      - Provided Athens with a high degree of administrative stability
      - Membership was an appointment by lot => each deme allocated a fixed number of candidates to be supplied each year
        - The fifty councilors from a tribe were known as the prytaneis
        - Ten tribal contingents took turns serving for one month of the ten-month civic year
        - Once a citizen was selected, he could not be selected for 10 years
      - Council came to be prominent with the ostracism of Kimon
        - Ostracized after Athenian help was rejected by Sparta
        - Paves the way for Kimon's rival, Perikles, to rise to power
        - Kimon's absence creates a vacuum where more radical politicians with increasingly democratic agendas come to the forefront
          - One of these politicians was Ephialtes, who focused his reforms on the Areopagus
      - After Ephialtes' reforms, the Boule drew up the agenda for the Ekklesia, reviews the suitability of elected officials, scrutinized the accounts of outgoing magistrates (euthyna), oversaw construction/maintenance of public buildings, oversaw fleet readiness, oversaw councils that handled taxes, leases, and revenues
      - Influence extended to every corner of civic life
      - Lived, slept, and dined in the Tholos
    - The Areopagus was a council that was made of life-long members: ex-archons
      - Served as an advisory role and homicide court
      - Ephialtes stripped away its unspecified powers that it used to employ to safeguard the constitution
        - Authority of the Areopagus to examine candidates' suitability (dokimasia) and to review outgoing magistrates' performance
        - Powers given to the Boule instead
        - Areopagus was populated with the most prominent men in the city and wasn't accountable to any democratic body => existence illustrated the "iron law of oligarchy", all democratic organizations inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies
        - Reforms mark the full emergence of the Kleisthenic Council of Five Hundred as the center of power in the Athenian state
    - Success and resilience of the arrangement demonstrated by the fact that the democracy of Demosthenes' time (200 years later) closely resembled the system created by Kleisthenes
      - Balanced the collective power of the Assembly with the administrative expertise of the Council
      - Relied on the existence of a small army of minor officials
        - The Thesmothetai (six magistrates) supervised the running of the law courts
          - Responsible for seeing that the law was enforced
          - Played no role in drafting the laws
        - The Poletai oversaw the public auction of confiscated goods
        - The Agoranomoi oversaw the use of legitimate weights and measures in the marketplace
        - The Sitophylakes monitored the grain supply to prevent price-fixing
        - The Logistai reviews the accounts of magistrates who handled public funds
- Democracy in Principle and in Action
  - The Ekklesia, Boule, and magistrates made it possible for Athens to function as a large, organized state
    - Accountability and oversight operated
  - Athens wary of the accretion of power by a single man after their experience with tyranny/Peisistratids/Persians
    - Official positions all rotate out frequently and act as part of a board
    - Power distribution and dissipation was a big focus
    - The bedrock principles of collegiality and annuality, like ostracism, reflect the ambivalence Athenians felt towards powerful individuals
  - Other aspects of the democratic system deserve comment
    - Practice of deliberating in an assembly wasn't restricted to the Ekklesia
      - Ten tribes also held their own assemblies, and were responsible for electing their own magistrates (Phylarchs) and the generals of the Athenian army
    - Demes of Athens held communal meetings, conducted sacrifices, and elected their own officials (Demarchs)
    - Existence of these organizations from demes all the way to the full Ekklesia was critical to the existence of the democracy
      - Deme => tribe => polis
      - Built on the replication of the same forms, practices, and habits
  - The Lawcourts and Oratory
    - Athenians saw the lawcourts as the crowning glory of their democracy
      - Also considered a source of entertainment
    - Massive juries (500, 1000, 1500 men)
    - Trials conducted with minimal attention to evidence or procedure
      - Evidence suggests that trials could be brutal affairs
    - Athenian democracy wasn't an ideology, it was a series of habits and practices that reinforced democratic behavior in different settings
      - Courts, theater, assembly, feast, etc.
    - Democratic behavior also asserted in the funeral oration
      - Event held at the end of the campaigning season when the Athenian community gathered to listen to a eulogy for the dead
      - Most famous example is an oration given by Perikles for those that died in the Peloponnesian War
        - Message that all living Athenian men were honor-bound to replicate the sacrifice of the the dead
        - Athenians fight for Athens
      - Praise of personal courage (arete) and the urge to win individual glory (kleos)
      - Demosian Sema (public cemetery) contained the collective bones of the Athenian dead
        - Egalitarian spirit present even among the dead
    - Powerful rhetoric characterized ancient democracy, but it also raised concerns of a prominent and persuasive individual harboring ambitions of tyranny
      - Enormous size of juries made tampering nearly impossible
      - System designed to give a vote and voice to as many men as possible
        - Participation not open to women, slaves, or foreigners
        - Some were more active than others
        - Success in Assembly depends on the power to speak well
    - Rhetoric training was the mark of an educated man
    - Another feature that worked against the egalitarian ethos of democracy: military
      - Generals could be elected year after year
      - Men that were a powerful speaker and a successful general could expect a long and distinguished career
        - These men tended to come from wealthy and high-born families
        - Referred to themselves as the Eupatridai (men of good birth)
        - Example: Perikles' domination of Athens for 20+ years
      - Wealth and aristocratic birth might seem antithetical to democracy, but Athens wouldn't be the last to reconcile dynastic policies with democracy
- The Imperial Democracy
  - Evidence suggests the politeia (constitution) of mid-5th century BCE Athens was growing more and more egalitarian
    - The eclipse of Kimon
    - The emergence of popular democratic leaders
    - The various reforms relating to eligibility and pay
    - The strengthening of the Boule
    - Impetus towards active participation by more people in the democracy also spurred by the involvement of more and more citizens
      - Magistrates to supervise affairs in allied states, fleet of triremes to patrol the Aegean
      - Machinery of empire: bureaucracy, fleet, army, and tax collection involved Athenians from every level of society
      - Democracy and empire depended on one another
  - Sphere of influence is primarily in the Aegean, but the generation of leaders after Kimon led to a new and aggressive policy towards other states
    - Central Greece => disgrace of Kimon turned public opinion against Sparta, causing the Athenians to extend influence into the region
      - Brought them into conflict with Thebes, period of conflict with Athens on one side and Sparta and Thebes on the other => First Peloponnesian War
    - Military expeditions taken on many other fronts
      - Significant gaps in our knowledge of Athenian activity in these years
    - Naval expedition to Cyprus, instructed to sail to Egypt to support an insurrection against the Persians
      - Eventually led to the Athenians being besieged by a different Persian general, leading to their defeat
  - Delian League in Crisis
    - In the first 20 years after the Persian Wars, the Athenians had projected their power across the Aegean, eradicating Persian influece
    - By the mid-450s BCE, the Athenians faced a very different landscape
      - Persia no longer an immediate threat
      - Sparta no longer a firm ally
      - Thebes and Megara were no longer friendly
      - Resistance to Athens from dissatisfied allies was everpresent
      - Egyptian disaster cost the Athenians dearly in ships and manpower
    - Egyptian crisis caused Athens to move the treasury from Delos to Athens
      - Precaution due to revolts in important allied states
      - Unambiguous signs of Athenian interventionalist, both constitutional and military
        - Set up a democratic constitution on Erythrai in response to a revolt, but Athenians were clearly the ones in charge
    - Kimon returns in 451 BCE, negotiating a treaty with Sparta and coinciding with more hostility from Persia
      - Kimon leads expeditionary force to Cyprus, likely to take advantage of revolts and dissatisfaction on the coast of the Persian empire
      - Asserted Athenian influence even further afield
      - Died on Cyprus, leading to Athenians returning home and abandoning further attempts to liberate the island
- A Peace of Kallias?
  - With Kimon dead, Perikles enjoyed a position of power that was distinctly undemocratic
    - Age referred to as Periklean Athens due to most of the major policy decisions coming from perikles
  - Periklean Athens
    - Pro-Spartan, anti-Persian policies associated with Kimon began to look old
      - Sparta had been on the opposing side of recent conflicts
      - Persians would likely stay out of Athenian business if they did the same
  - Formal treaty with Persia has become one of the key problems of 5th-century history
    - The reconstruction of the Delian League records known as the Athenian Tribute Lists
      -  A missing record leads to suggestion that the missing year was the year following Kimon's death, which opened up an opportunity to negotiate with Persia
      - Negotiator referred to as Kallias => Treaty of Kallias
      - Alliance with Persia means tributes are being paid for nothing => leads to a gap year in the records and fluctuation in tributes in following years
    - Never mentioned by Thucydides
    - Athenian contemporaries who mention the treaty are inconsistent with each other and the rest of our historical knowledge
- Colonies and Cleruchies
  - Decade of the 440s BCE marks an effort by the Athenians to reestablish firm control of the League
    - Development of a clear set of practices that served to confirm the imperial control of the Aegean
      - Intervening with military forces, founding colonies, establishing cleruchies in allied territory, imposing Athenian weights and measures, subjecting allies to Athenian courts, etc.
  - Colonies
    - Colonies became a means for Athens to assert its control over members of the League
    - Athenians campaigned in Boiotia in 446 BCE
      - Captured the city of Chaironeia and enslaved the population
      - Defeated later by the Boiotians, sparking unrest among the Athenian allies
      - Cities of Euboia went into revolt, forcing Perikles to lead a major Athenian expedition to calm them down
        - Resultant dealings suggestive of the importance of the appearance of legality in their dealings with subject states and framing as good practice by the Athenians
        - Set of regulations spelling out what the colony can expect from Athenian imperial power
      - Athenians exerted an imbalance of power on suppressed peoples
    - Colony founded at Brea in the northern Aegean
      - Strategic interest due to timber and resources
      - Designed to secure an Athenian presence in the region
      - Athens promised to help, provided the colonists met their obligations to the mother city
      - Clear that the incentive to leave Athens for Brea was land, divided into parcels for incoming colonists
      - Colonists drawn from bottom 2 tiers of the Solonian property classes
      - Opportunity for soldiers to join the colony upon their return
      - Fresh start, but with significant ties to Athens
  - Cleruchies
    - Resembled colonies in that they involved the allocation of land in allied/foreign territory to the Athenians
    - Cleruchs retained Athenian citizenship and obligation to military service
    - Constituted an effective tool for imperial control of the Aegean
    - Flourished during the time when Athens was at risk of losing control of the Delian League
      - Persian Wars fading into the past, Athenian justification for empire growing slim
      - Athenians' hegemonial power became the main threat to allies
    - Athenians pacified states that were rebellious by seizing their land
    - Evidence that the instatement of cleruchies made the original communities incapable of paying at their pre-revolt rates
    - Profited the richest Athenians, who gained land overseas
      - Key feature of Athenian control of productive land, one of the primary economic resources of the Aegean world
- Coercion
  - Tribute (phoros) was the most irksome aspect of Athenian imperial control
    - Most obvious sign of the allies' subordination
  - Athenians hostile to the democracy also dissatisfied
    - Saw that empire and democracy went hand-in-hand, with the navy linking them
    - The navy was a tool of imperial control and an expression of the egalitarian spirit of Athens
    - Some saw the greatness of Athens as linked to its moral decline
  - By the time of the Peloponnesian War, Athens had come to rely on its empire to supply it with grain and revenue
    - this supply was threatened by war
    - Increased control of trade throughout the Aegean
    - Drop in allies minting their own coinage, a sign of decreasing autonomy among the states of the Delian League
  - Decision made to cancel tributes altogether, replacing it with a 5% tax on imports and exports
  - Every state within the Delian League required to adopt Athenian weights and measures
    - Political and economic decisions that moved the Aegean towards free trade coincided with the loss of Athenian control in the region



## Reading 9: Inclusion and Exclusion: Life in Periklean Athens

- Two aspects of Athenian life changes under Perikles: Drama and the Akropolis
  - Drama
    - Tragedy and comedy important genres
    - "Parademocratic" in that it was a socially constructed performance whose form and nature reinforced the egalitarian ethos of Athenian democracy
  - Akropolis
    - The primary location in Athens where the Athenian community defined its identity, memorialized its past, and exalted itself as a democratic empire
- 3 groups excluded from democratic participation: women, slaves, and resident aliens
- Drama
  - Athenians expressed a complex worldview through tragedy, comedy, and satyr plays
    - Always direct in portraying the whole range of human experience
    - Ancient drama differs from modern interpretation by virtue of its function in ancient society
    - Performed as parts of festivals in honor of Dionysus
      - Civic, religious, and communal events
  - Origins of Drama
    - Probably lie in the agricultural festivals that celebrated the harvest
      - Young men and women would perform songs and dances called dithyrambs in honor of Dionysus
      - Speaking parts of the protagonist and antagonist would later be added, beginning the transition from choral performance to drama
    - Greek drama consisted primarily of odes sung by the chorus
      - Punctuated by sections/episodes where two characters exchanged alternating lines of dialogue (stichomythia)
      - Sharp expression of opposing viewpoints => encouraged and expressed agonistic exchanges
        - Antigone vs. Creon, Medea vs. Jason, Helen vs. Hekuba
    - Eventual addition of a third character
      - Actors assume different roles with heavy robes, costumes, and masks
      - Standard archetypes occurred: messenger, nurse, heroine, etc.
      - The chorus was a kind of character, often identified with town elders or subordinate characters
        - Offered normative reactions that responded to the chaotic and subversive actions of the principal actors
        - Over time, the chorus became less commentary focused, but their roots in song and dance remained
    - Most plots taken from either the story of the Trojan War and its aftermath or the Seven Against Thebes cycle
    - What made these plays so powerful?
      - Conventional plots, simplicity of structure, lack of special effects make them seem boring
      - The serious topics they touched on: murder, incest, parricide, execution, etc.
      - Drama was an aural experience
        - Combinations of long and short syllables in words and phrases could be employed to create metrical schemes
        - Poetic quality of different meters engaged the audience
        - The actor's ability to imbue a character with emotion through posture, facial expression, diction, etc. would be worthless in ancient times
  - Katharsis
    - Aristotle claims katharsis was the key to effective drama
    - Katharsis is the process by which the audience is cleansed of their worst impulses and fears by being forced to contemplate the unthinkable
      - The revelation to Oedipus that he had committed patricide and incest
    - A suggestion that anyone can do horrific things
    - Partly caused by the relief that the viewer is not in the character's shoes
    - Challenges the audience by dramatizing conflicts between fundamentally irreconcilable value systems
      - Antigone vs. Creon
  - The Dionysia
    - Tragedy performed under particular conditions at two festivals: the Dionysia and the Lenaia
      - 3 tragedians selected, each of which produced a trilogy to be performed on a single day of the festival
      - Crown offered to the best tragedian
    - Tragedy had a meaningful connection to the worship of Dionysus
      - A god that represented threats to social order and transgression, but also order and civilization
      - The celebration of the great Dionysia was a festival that celebrated the normative roles of people in society by purging the most antisocial drives within the population
      - Theater offered a place to explore the worst, most antisocial psychoses, binding the democratic community together
    - Many plays explore the dilemmas of piety and obligation at the level of the individual and of the community
      - Often reflect their contemporary setting and issues
  - Comedy
    - Comic plays also performed at the Dionysia and Lenaia in competition
    - Investigation of prevailing habits and attitudes, satirized foolishness, and tested tolerance
    - Fifth century BCE => Old Comedy, Fourth century BCE => Menander
      - Old Comedy more robust
      - Showing that comedy was a thoroughly democratic genre
  - The Democracy of Drama
    - Both comedies and tragedies were experienced by the community together in the theater of Dionysus
    - Status of the performers balanced by the large, anonymous audience, who exercised a controlling power on the performance
      - Results in the theater resembling the social dynamic of the democratic assembly
    - Helped constitute the inclusivity of the Athenian community
    - Reinforced the shared belief that reverence for the gods was characteristic of the Athenians and flowed into communal relations
    - In the eyes of the Athenians, to be a part of the Athenian community, one had to be a participant in all the rituals, sacrifices, and processions that marked everyday Athenian life
- The Akropolis
  - Participation in the world of drama as a producer, actor, playwright, or audience member meant inclusion within the Athenian community
  - At the height of Periklean Athens' power, the Akropolis was radically reimagined as an expression of both that power and the shared identity of the Athenians
  - The Parthenon, Propylaia, and Erechtheion are tangible proof that in Periklean Athens, democracy, community, and imperial power were inextricably bound to each other through religion
  - The Akropolis' rebuilding after the Persians sacked Athens funded by religious piety and imperial power
    - Tribute from Delian League allies would be taken by Athens, and 1/60 of the tribute would be set aside for Athena (aparchai)
    - Athenians transferred additional money to this fund, helping to finance the building program devised by Perikles
  - Architectural transformation began after the moving of the treasury from Delos to Athens
    - Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheion, Nike temple, sanctuary of Brauronian Artemis, Chalkotheke, etc.
    - Controversy over use of funds for buildings rather than defense, allies complain
  - The Parthenon and Propylaia
    - The Parthenon was a massive temple dedicated to Athena
      - Praised for innovations and refinement of architecture
        - Built with an eye to the existing topography of the Akropolis
        - Part of a landscape of memory, where new buildings related to their predecessors
      - Incorporated the recent past of the Persian Wars as well as the deep past of the Mycenaeans
        - Shows Athenian belief in their autochthonous nature
        - Ancestral connection to the Athenian Akropolis
      - Drew on conventional design and added onto it, creating something radicalized
        - Classic art on the exterior metopes, complemented with a new Ionic frieze
        - First major Greek temple decorated by idealized versions of the people visiting it, not gods or heroes
        - Proof of the confidence of Athenians at the height of their power
      - Articulation of how the imperial democratic community was embodied as a pious sacrificial community
      - Housed a massive gold/ivory statue of Athena, made by Pheidias
        - Fully armored, reflective of the warrior qualities celebrated at the Panathenaia
    - The Propylaia was a monumental gateway at the entrance to the Akropolis
      - Salamis, the site of the Athenians' naval victory over the Persians becomes the backdrop to the visitor's pilgrimage to the Akropolis
  - The Erechtheion
    - The rebuilding process consistently deployed similar architectural orders and designs to make the visual environment of the Akropolis consistent
    - The most sacred spot on the Akropolis
      - Challenge to design a building to bring architectural cohesion to a spot where there were so many cults and sacred associations
        - Location of the xoanon (olive wood statue), where Athenians prayed to Athena
    - Irregularity of various levels associated with the building
      - Many internal complexities and irregularities
    - Complex creates an illusion of orderly arrangement
  - Symbols of Power
    - Athens' enormous power is deployed in honoring the gods, endorsing the greatness of Athens
    - Periklean building programs looks much like a public works program, financing a workforce
      - Puts money into circulation, stimulating the economy vs. the passive wealth of tribute
    - Fashioning of a sacred topography
      - Akropolis a unique expression of the unity of religion, democracy, and imperial power
      - Archaic temples that had been torn down by the Persians replaced by stelai containing the decisions, laws, treaties, casualty lists, and honorary decrees of the democracy
    - Democracy found a visual language for expressing the power, pride, and common identity of all Athenians
- Power and Exclusion
  - Much of the cultural production of Athens is intimately bound up with democracy
  - Society still excluded the likes of women, slaves, and foreign residents
  - Women in Classical Athens
    - Very few female voices in antiquity, their status must be interpreted as representing men's attitudes towards women
      - "Women are men's affliction"
      - "We have courtesans for pleasure, concubines for the daily service of our bodies, and wives for the production of legitimate offspring"
    - Wives served to provide children who could inherit the family's property
      - Legalistic basis made clear by the word engye, meaning a betrothal and a contract
      - Contract not between man and woman, but between the woman's father and the husband
      - Image of the anonymous, silent wife, waiting patiently at home for her husband is somewhere between reality and the Athenian man's ideal marriage
      - Evidence to show that women could participate in family council, but cloistering of women is undeniable
      - Social organization secludes women as much as possible
      - Dramatic difference in agency reinforced by the age difference at the time of marriage
        - Men didn't look for companionship in marriage
          - Semi-formalization of mistresses and prostitutes (symposia)
    - The general theme of democracy in Athens blinds us to the fact that there were gross inequalities in the treatment of those excluded from Athenian citizenship
      - Allies, slaves, women, etc. relationships with the Greek man seen as an assertion of their power
    - Depiction of heterosexual sex as an expression of physical dominance
  - Pederasty
    - Pederasty was distinctively and identifiably Greek
    - Relationship between the erastes (older man) and the eromenos (younger boy)
      - Erastes is the active partner and the eromenos is the passive partner
    - Possibly compensating for the lack of affectionate heterosexual relationships
    - Ancient civilizations may see this as an expression of the boding that can occur in hypermasculine settings
      - Others not the aristocratic milieu in which pederasty functions
    - Two common denominators running through the various forms of pederasty known in the Greek world
      - The erastes was the penetrator and the eromenos was penetrated, playing the same role as the woman or slave
      - The eromenos would eventually outgrow his role and become an erastes
    - Served as a kind of sexual initiation
      - A youth who was praised as kalos (beautiful) would have to grow up and shed that status
    - Despite the notions of this relationship, two grown men living together in a homosexual relationship was seen as disgusting
      - In this case, the eromenos became a kinaidos
  - Slavery
    - Agricultural workers and miners (doulai) worked the fields and dug silver out of the ground
      - Agricultural workforce in Attica was primarily made up of slaves
      - Gymnetes in Argos, Koniopodes in Epidauros, helots in Sparta, and penestai in Thessaly
    - In many places, the slaves were identified as the original inhabitants of the region
      - Suggests that slave owners tried to ethnically distinguish themselves from their slaves
    - Athens' slaves came from a much wider variety of nationalities
      - Non-Greekness of the slaves made it easier to see slaves as "income-earning bodies"
      - Strong ethnic overlay to the slave/free distinction => skin color, accent, etc.
    - Within the oikos, there were household slaves (the oiketai)
      - Wove cloth, cooked, and waited in attendance on the master and mistress of the house
      - Generally better living conditions than agricultural slaves
    - The choris oikountes ("those who dwell apart")
      - Semi-independent craftsmen whose labor and products supported themselves and their owners
    - Public slaves, the demosioi
      - Helped day-to-day running of Athens
      - Clerks, secretaries, streetsweepers, police force, etc.
    - Large numbers of slaves made punishment necessary for compliance, like in Sparta
    - Clearest expression of power dynamics in Athenian society
      - Women as sexual objects
      - Allies as subjects
      - Slaves are barely human => only a body
        - Testimony taken through torture, as the slave cannot be relied on for their intellect
    - Athenians' justifications of slavery required logical somersaults
      - Aristotle believes mastery is the telos (proper function) of the slave relationship
      - Objections to slavery muted and the institution unchallenged through antiquity
    - Slavery was a feature of Periklean Athens
      - Class of men had time to pursue philosophy, poetry, and other pursuits of high culture
        - Schole
        - Made possible due to the large class of slaves that made time
- Metics
  - Much of the trade and manufacturing that took place was conducted by metics
    - Resident aliens who paid a tax (the metoikion) to live in Athens
    - Rarely given the chance to become Athenian citizens
    - Required to register in an Athenian deme and have an Athenian patron
  - Catch-all title
    - Some were freeborn people who moved to Athens to take advantage of the growing economy
    - Some were former slaves that had acquired freedom
  - Formal status difficult to distinguish at the lower ranks of Athenian society



## Reading 10: Religion and Philosophy: Belief and Knowledge in the Classical Age

- A system of beliefs and practices, often referred to as a polis-religion, served to keep Athens together during the Classical Age
  - Religion bound the city together as a community and the polis shaped Greek religion
  - Shared sacrifices and religious festivals brought people together, creating common bonds of affiliation
  - Philosophy presented alternative ways of understanding the world that challenged conventional thought
    - Called into question many of the dominant conventions at the time, threatening the society characterized by slavery, disenfranchised women, and class tensions between the wealthy and poor
- Polis-Religion
  - Communal religion begins at the birth of a male child, when the Athenian father would introduce the baby to other members of his religious fraternity (the phratry) in an Apatouria festival
    - Later reintroduced at 18, signaling their acceptance by the phratores
    - The young Athenian would then serve as an ephebe (hoplite in training), guarding the border of Athens
    - Upon their return, they would take up their place as soldiers and citizens
    - Phratry acted as the individual's extended family, and could vouch for their status as citizens
  - Female coming of age is also very important, but differs from their male counterparts
    - Male coming of age is equated with his training as a citizen-soldier
    - Female coming of age is associated with the onset of menstruation, signaling the readiness to bear children
    - Religious ritual provided the medium by which the girl's social identity was transformed, with recorded evidence at the sanctuary of Brauron
      - She was closer to her role as wife and mother
      - "Playing the bear"
      - The girl was now available for marriage, or, at least, betrothal
    - Inscriptions from the sanctuary of Artemis on the Akropolis reveal that women continued to make dedications to Artemis at later points in their lives
      - Major events (childbirth, marriage, etc.) were marked by offerings to the goddess
      - Leaving behind of the woman's most expensive garments
      - Concrete way of demonstrating piety and receiving the goddess' favor
- Purification and Sacrifice
  - A wide variety of religious practices occurred on a daily basis in the Greek world
    - Allow us to glimpse how orthopraxy (correct behavior towards the gods) modified all aspects of life
    - Guides normative conduct and restores peace and harmony to society and the individual
      - Ex: how does one get rid of a ghost (elasteros) that is haunting their house?
        - Victim compared to someone guilty of homicide => they faced complete social rejection
        - Could be a family ghost or a foreign ghost
    - Sacrifices in rituals
      - Libations and meat
      - Clause forbids meat from leaving the sanctuary after the ritual, confirming these sacrifices resulted in a feast
  - For the Greeks, religion was very much concerned with regulating behavior to ensure a harmonious relationship between humans and the divine
    - Harmony could be threatened by pollution (bloodshed, oath-breaking, etc.) or by impious actions
  - Priests responsible for sanctuaries are authorized to safeguard the most humble aspects of their gods' property
    - Weight of the local deme + the Athenian demos and Boule behind them
  - Sacrifice
    - Greek religion always retained a powerful performative component
    - The most distinctive feature of polis-religion: the ubiquity of sacrifice
    - Athenians regarded eusebeia (piety) as their most distinctive quality
      - Required regular affirmation through action
    - Combination of well-known Olympian deities, minor gods and goddesses, and obscure local heroes
      - Continuous sacrifices to these figures documented in religious texts
    - The most fundamental civic duty of an Athenian
    - Actions are formulaic, repeated, and comforting
    - Occurred on a sliding scale: from the entire city and the Panathenaia, to demes and phratries, to smaller sacrificial groups
- Religion and Commerce
  - Leases involving demes, phratries, and the city of Athens as a whole show that religion cannot be separated from any of the community's activities
  - Activities from farming to festivals were associated with religious practice
- Conventional Belief
  - Universe ruled by a supreme sky god, Zeus, who reigned with Hera
    - Zeus and his brothers (Poseidon and Hades) had defeated the primordial Titans and Giants
    - They divided the cosmos between them
  - Athena sprung from the head of Zeus, representing wisdom and technical skills
  - Aphrodite incarnated the power of sexual desire
  - Ares gave a human face to the gruesome bloodlust of battle
  - This order represented a triumph over chaos
  - Gods are figures who resemble us and have areas of power that directly intersect with our lives
  - Knowledge of the gods was transmitted by a rich supply of stories that have become part of our cultural consciousness
    - Shed light on the Greek conception of the mortal and divine realms, along with how they interact
    - In these stories, gods are both human and divine, looking and behaving very much like us
    - Breaking down of barriers between human and divine
      - If gods could behave badly, then the same could be expected of mortals
      - If gods were similar to us, they were more approachable and could provide assistance
  - Opposite of the urge to win the gods' intercession was a fear of their power
    - Euripides' *Bacchae* has no story of redemption or forgiveness, just a brutal reality of Dionysus' power
  - Eleusis
    - The divine was vividly real, but even the most personal religious experience was subject to polis-religion
    - Eleusis was politically a deme in Attica, but the sanctuary of Demeter was under the control of two local clans: the Eumolpidai and the Kerykes
    - Importance of the site grows with the enlargement of the sanctuary
      - Most notably, the Telesterion (Hall of Mysteries), where people were initiated into a cult connected to the cycle of seasons and worship of the Earth Mother
      - Transformation of a private cult into a state cult, paid for by the collective contributions of the Athenians
    - Each mystes (initiate) was meant to experience the appearance of the goddess Demeter at the culmination of the ceremony
      - Participants were purified through fasting and likely under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs
      - Initiation involved drinking a mixture called kykeon
      - Priming to witness the epiphany of the goddess' arrival
      - Offered the prospect of a happy afterlife to the initiates
    - Closely tied to celebrations of the fertility of the land and the origins of agriculture
    - Site has strategic significance for Athens, as it bordered Megara, an enemy of the polis
      - Laid claim to the area which was "responsible" for all civilized life (agriculture)
    - Athens builds a counterpart to the sanctuary called the City Eleusinion within Athens
      - Similar to how the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron was matched by an urban Brauronion on the Akropolis
      - Connected center and periphery, transforming the entire region into a religious landscape
    - Athenians sent ephebes to bring sacred objects from Eleusis to Athens as part of a ritual
      - Marched back to Eleusis, and are verbally abused at a river crossing (gephyrismos)
      - Were then initiated into the mystery cult
      - Mass movement of people requiring planning, preparation, and regulation by the state and religious authorities
    - Another such cult was the Orpheotelestai ("Initiates of Orpheus")
      - Upon death, offered an incantation that they would use when they woke up in the afterlife
- Shared Beliefs and Scripture
  - Religion in the Greek world did speak to the deepest spiritual needs of ordinary people
  - No belief that their texts were handed down directly from any god as a guide to ethical behavior
    - Did believe in divine inspiration for their poets
    - Did not regard any poem as the equivalent of scripture
  - Homer and Hesiod seen as authoritative, but no one was punished for disagreeing with them
  - Religion generally characterized by a tendency to find similarity between the gods of different peoples rather than to assert their own gods' superiority
  - Rare instances of religious persecution in the Greek world
    - Usually a charge of asebeia (impiety)
    - Usually aimed at controversial public figures
    - Trials motivated as much by social anxieties and political upheavals as by religious scruples
  - Discussions of cosmology are those recorded by a literary elite, not clear that ordinary Greeks shared them
  - Sacrifice, festival, and procession were the ingredients of religion, together constructing community

- The Oracle of Delphi
  - Delphi was considered the center of the world
  - Mystery on how the oracle operated
    - Ancient sources refer to a chasm through which fumes would have risen, intoxicating Pythia with the god's spirit and uttering his prophecies
    - Geological evidence may show proof of these gasses, but they wouldn't have created the perfect hexameter poetry that history tells us about
      - Likely that Apollo's priests played a significant role in shaping the god's communications
  - Delphi's magnificence is characterized by the treasuries, statues, tripods, and other dedications that made it the wealthiest and most prestigious location in Greece
  - Temple ravaged by natural calamities
    - Ex: earthquake of 373 BCE
    - The Amphiktyony (association of Greek cities that controlled Delphi) would contribute more and more money towards its rebuilding
  - Political influence and piety intertwined
    - The Alkmaionidai attempting to curry favor from the oracle to bring about their return from exile
    - Possessed very little political power of its own, but was the symbolic center of a network of Greek states
    - Advice given has a powerful effect on the lives of states and inidividuals
  - The oracle in myth reveals how it operated within the Greeks' belief system
    - The gods listened and gave signs
    - Humans still had to interpret their messages, frequently posed as puzzles or enigmas
    - Offered broad moral guidance, articulating an ethical code that applied to all Greeks, uniting them



## Reading 11:

- 



## Summary 1: Why Study the Greeks?

- Cultures in Dialogue
  - Across a range of human activities, from medicine and architecture to poetry and mathematics, contemporary western culture reveals a powerful connection to the world of the ancient Greeks
- Truth and beauty
  - The Greeks' preoccupation with truth and beauty are particularly relevant in today's world, saturated as it is by pop culture
- Democracy, Ancient and Modern
  - The complexity of our relationship to the Greeks is conveyed by different ideas of democracy: participatory versus representative
  - The paradox of envisioning an ideal society while recognizing its flaws is another point of contact between the Greeks and us
- Greek Architecture and Philosophy
  - The tension between similarity and difference can be explored in architecture, where similar forms hide different functions
  - In philosophy, we follow paths set by the Greeks, yet in areas of human rights there are deep voids unexplored by the Greeks
- East versus West?
  - The danger of placing the Greeks on a pedestal is that it fits a western-oriented interpretation of history, denigrating other cultures as inferior
  - Modern instances of this demonizing of the Other show that ideologically freighted history remains a danger
- Paideia
  - Just as the Greeks moved towards a more inclusive notion of Greekness, replacing blood with culture, so too we face the challenge of esteeming the Greeks and understanding their accomplishments while still respecting other cultures



## Summary 2: Early Greece and the Minoans: The Labyrinth and the Minotaur

- Greece in the Neolithic: The Origins of Complex Societies
  - From the Franchthi Cave and a number of other sites (including Dikili Tash, Alepotrypa, Sesklo, and Dimini), a picture emerges of gradually increasing social complexity and stratification
  - Successive sites have also been identified at such places as Gournia and Pseira
- The Third Millennium
  - Complex societies appeared in a number of regions around Greece in the third millennium, notably in Attica at Tsepi, on Aegina, and on many of the islands of the Aegean
  - Particularly interesting, but somewhat enigmatic, is the Cycladic culture
- Minoan Crete
  - On Crete, a society emerged based on the great palaces of Knossos, Phaistos, and Malia
  - Palatial culture relied on a redistributive economy
  - The palaces were also religious and cultic centers
- Beyond the Palaces
  - In other parts of Crete, smaller settlements have also been identified at places, such as Gournia and Pseira.
  - Outside Crete, Minoan culture is also on display as far away as Lemnos and Thera
  - Cretan-style bull-jumping is also evident at Avaris in Egypt
- Thera: A Minoan Settlement
  - The richest evidence for Minoan culture and daily life in the Bronze Age comes from Thera
  - Wall paintings reveal a vivid appreciation of nature
  - Some scenes may also depict naval expeditions, calling to mind Homer's poems
- The End of Minoan Culture
  - The theory that Minoan culture was destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption is assessed
  - Gradual incursion by Mycenaean elements is also examined as a possible explanation for the end of Minoan culture
- Interpreting the Past
  - The role of Sir Arthur Evans and the practice of restoration is examined
  - How we imagine the past plays a key role in how we interpret the past



## Summary 3: Mycenae: Rich in Gold

- Schliemann and the Creation of the Bronze Age
  - An obsessive but unscrupulous man, Schliemann uncovered the sites of Troy and Mycenae but left a legacy of dishonesty that raises a question mark over his discoveries
  - Even so, he gave Homer's poems a material context, increasing the likelihood of an historical kernel to the poems
- The Origins of the People of the Shaft Graves
  - The wealth of Mycenae, rich in gold, raises questions regarding the origins of Late Bronze Age Mycenaean culture
  - Some scholars think Mycenaean mercenary were employed by Pharaoh
  - Recent studies point toward trade connections with the Danube basin
- The Mycenaean World
  - The physical remains at Mycenae point to a warrior aristocracy whose power was expressed in monumental architecture: massive walls, imposing relief sculpture, and impressive corbeled tombs
  - Recent work also shows that the citadel was surrounded by a larger settlement
  - Linear B tablets allow us to recreate the highly centralized production, storage and distribution characteristic of the Mycenaean economy
- Mycenaean Knossos
  - Linear B evidence also fits with mythical traditions regarding the relations of Mycenae and Crete in the late Bronze Age
  - The final phase of complex palatial life at Knossos was dominated by Mycenaeans from the mainland
- Troy and Homer
  - The relationship between archaeological evidence and literary evidence is most acute in the so-called Homeric question: do the Homeric poems accurately reveal the world of the Bronze Age, and are the poems' descriptions of the Trojan War reliable?
  - This debate turns on both the formulaic quality of Homer's poetry and the recent controversial interpretation of the material culture of Troy
- The Collapse of Mycenaean Culture
  - The end of the Bronze Age in Greece has been prompted a wide variety of explanations, from climate change to foreign invasion
  - It is likely that there was widespread upheaval around the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC
  - The collapse of Mycenaean palatial culture was symptomatic of a broader systems collapse across the Levant



## Summary 4: The Iron Age

- Center and Periphery
  - In the Iron Age, some former citadels were still occupied but new societies can be seen at such places as Lefkandi
  - At some sites, such as Kalapodi, there is evidence of continuity of cult
  - New communities were dominated by chieftains who saw Homer's heroes as models for their own authority
  - Homer's poems are not relics of the Bronze Age but represent the use of the past in shaping a new identity
- Polis and Ethnos
  - In some parts of Greece the *oikoi*, or households of the elite, coalesced to form larger communities, the first *poleis*, or city-states
  - Other regions retained more dispersed settlements and looser political bonds, identifying as *ethne*, or ethnic units, and sometimes as political federations, or *koina*
  - Temples were often the focal point of early communities. Religious authority helped stabilize these states
  - Rulers' palaces were often transformed into gods' houses
- A Greek Diaspora
  - Colonization and trade are distinctive features of the eighth and seventh centuries
  - Greeks were part of a broader Mediterranean network
  - This cultural contact exposed them to older cultures, stories, languages, and even such phenomena as writing
  - Delphi played a key role in endorsing Greek colonies
  - Indigenous populations were for the most part demonized
  - The Olympics developed at the same time, helping a Greek identity to coalesce



## Summary 5: The Archaic Age: Sparta

- Archaic Crisis
  - Increasing travel, trade, and colonization brought challenges to the Greeks of the Archaic period
  - There is evidence for the emergence of many unfree groups: essentially serfs tied to the land
  - Competition, strife, and warfare between communities were characteristic of the Archaic period
  - These tensions were only exacerbated by the introduction of coinage and the emergence of a monetized economy
- Early Sparta
  - Sparta followed a unique course of development
  - Five villages federated, but Sparta always remained spatially decentralized
  - Some religious practices suggest a strong identification with Homer's heroes and heroines, but other cult spots, such as the throne of Apollo at Amyklai, were unique
  - The conquest of neighboring Messenia put Sparta on a different path
  - Full citizens were trained as full-time warriors, supported by the labor and produce of the enslaved helots
- The Great Rhetra
  - An account of the constitution, preserved in Plutarch centuries later, records details of the Spartan system of government
  - Ultimate power lay in the hands of the people. In an important amendment, the kings and council were given veto power
  - Spartan culture was vibrant in the Archaic period but gradually lost impetus
  - The transformation of Sparta lay in the increasing focus on warfare as a permanent state of affairs
  - Sparta's relations with the neighboring states of the Peloponnese also reflect an emphasis on regional hegemony



## Summary 6: The Archaic Age: Athens

- Competition and Rivalry
  - The early Athenian state was subject to a good deal of aristocratic rivalry and violence
  - There is also evidence for many social organizations that structured the life of the Athenians in tribes, brotherhoods, clans, and households
  - The adoption of coinage was viewed with suspicion by many who saw land and aristocratic values being replaced by the desire for wealth
  - Early Athenian law also points to a society still reliant on religious and family ties to underpin state institutions
- Solon
  - When civil unrest had almost reached the level of civil war in early Athens, Solon was appointed to resolve the continuing crisis
  - He focused on relieving the burden of debt afflicting share-croppers, and instituted a "shaking off" of burdens, the *Seisachtheia*
  - He also created a new, clear system of census classifications based on wealth in order to make political participation predictable and orderly
  - Across a range of fields, from funerary legislation to the law on tyranny, Solon's legislation represents a comprehensive attempt to put the Athenians state on a secure footing
- Peisistratos
  - In the short term Solon failed, and his time in office was followed by more faction fighting.
  - Out of these regional conflicts arose Peisistratos, who ruled Athens as tyrant throughout the middle of the sixth century
  - Despite tyranny's reputation, Peisistratos had a lasting positive influence on Athens, encouraging the development of a unified Athenian identity, prosperity and stability
  - After his death his sons continued to rule with the cooperation of other leading families but were seen as harsh and ruthless, resulting in assassination of Hipparchos and the exile of Hippias
- Kleisthenes
  - As regional violence threatened once again to engulf Athens a new leader emerged: Kleisthenes
  - He proposed a radical new political system, based on an entirely new organization of the state
  - The entire region of Attica, made up of 139 demes, was divided into ten new tribes
  - Each tribe was made of three thirds, each drawn from one of the regional districts of Attica
  - The result, building on Solon's reforms and Peisistratos's stability, was to give the Athenians a solid democratic foundation for their state
  - Kleisthenes disappears from history, but thanks to his and the earlier reforms of Solon and Peisistratos, the Athenians were in a position to survive the coming Persian invasions



## Summary 7: Persia

- Greece Prior to the Persian Wars
  - Greece was part of a zone of cultural interaction that stretched across the eastern Mediterranean and beyond
  - The Greeks labeled "barbarian" those whose speech they found difficult to understand
  - The phenomenon of "Othering," or emphasizing cultural difference, is a process that would sharply increase as a result of the Persian Wars
- Persia
  - Originally a semi-nomadic people of the steppes, the Persians entered the region of Iran before 700 BC
  - The same region had been home to various early cultures, making up a patchwork of peoples and kingdoms
  - The Persians came to dominate the region during the reign of Cyrus the Elder
    - His dynasty is called Achaemenid, named after the semi-mythical founder of the dynasty, Achaemenes
- The Achaemenids  
  - Cyrus and his successors fashioned a powerful empire
    - A religion focused on the Sky God, Ahura Mazda, provided unity and underpinned the dynasty
  - The empire depended on tribute from every region, and power was often given to local governors, called satraps
  - Persepolis served as the capital and symbolic center of this vast domain
  - Darius continued the territorial expansion of the Persian empire, crossing into Europe in 513 BC
  - A revolt of the Ionian Greeks in 499 BC brought the Persians into direct conflict with the Athenians
- Greece versus Persia
  - The Persians dispatched a force in 490 BC to punish the Athenians for having participated in the Ionian revolt
    - The Persians landed at Marathon but were defeated by the Athenian army
  - In the decade that followed Darius died and was succeeded by his son, Xerxes, who planned a much larger invasion by land and by sea.
  - Xerxes' army advanced slowly but the Greek response was hesitant and poorly coordinated
    - After the Greeks withdrew from Tempe in northern Greece in 480 BC, a smaller army, led by Leonidas of Sparta, fortified the position at Thermopylae to slow the Persian advance.
  - After the death of Leonidas, his 300 Spartans, and 700 Thespians, the Greeks still debated how and where to meet the Persians
  - Athens was evacuated and sacked
  - The Greek forces took to their ships and met the Persians at Salamis, where the Greeks were victorious
  - The Great King left Greece but his army only withdrew to Central Greece to winter quarters
  - The Persians came south again in 479 BC and were defeated at the Battle of Plataia
- Aftermath
  - The Greeks continued the war against Persia
  - Offerings of thanks for the Greek victory were dedicated at Delphi
  - In the decades to come, the triumph of the Greeks often resulted in an ugly triumphalism
  - The Persians were mocked as effeminate, and the cultural production of the Golden Age, whether on stage, in writing or visually, made frequent use of xenophobic stereotypes
    - Victory had come at a cost



## Summary 8: Democracy and Empire

- Introduction: From Ruin to Recovery
  - Immediately after the Persian Wars, the Greeks went on the offensive and undertook the expulsion of the Persians from the Aegean
  - The Athenians soon took over the Greek alliance from the Spartans and began a vigorous campaign throughout the Aegean
  - Although some episodes were designed to expel the Persians, many were thinly veiled attempts to secure control of the grain route from the Black Sea to Athens
  - Within no more than a decade, the Delian League had been transformed from a free alliance into an Athenian naval empire.
- Democratic Institutions
  - As the empire flourished abroad, so did democracy at home
  - The Ekklesia was open to all male adult citizens
  - The random selection of archons by lot replaced popular election, and payment for jury service also encouraged participation in democratic government
  - The Boulê, or Council of Five Hundred, administered affairs on a daily basis
    - Annual elections and the rotation of office meant that power was spread across a broad swathe of the citizen population
  - Many boards of magistrates also serving annually similarly helped avoid the aggregation of power in the hands of a narrow clique
  - The lawcourts were looked upon as the truest indication of the broad basis of Athenian democracy
    - Massed juries exercised the power of life and death
    - Oratory, as a consequence, was a highly prized skill
- The Imperial Democracy
  - Over the course of the 5th century BC the Athenians came to rely on the empire as a source of wealth, through tribute
  - The empire depended on an apparatus of government entirely supplied by the men of Athens as administrators, tax collectors, garrison commanders, soldiers, and sailors
  - The generation of Kimon saw Persia as the enemy, but Perikles saw the rift with Sparta as more pressing
  - From the middle of the fifth century, Athenian policy turned away from Persia and began to focus on conflict with Sparta and her allies
  - The Peace of Kallias likely represents an attempt by the Athenians to reach an understanding with the Persians in order to keep them out of the Aegean
- Colonies and Cleruchies
  - The Athenians used colonies to encourage the poor and the landless to leave Athens
  - Cleruchies functioned in the same way as Athenian colonies but allowed the settlers to remain Athenian citizens
    - This often relegated local populations to an inferior status
  - Even more irksome, according to Thucydides, was the system of tribute, by which the allies paid for their own servitude
  - Eventually the Athenians cancelled the entire system and replaced it with a flat 5% tax



## Summary 9: Inclusion and Exclusion: Life in Periklean Athens

- Drama
  - Greek drama probably grew out of the songs and dances accompanying rural festivals
  - Plots tended to be taken from well-known myth cycles, such as the Trojan War and the Seven Against Thebes Cycle
  - Robes and masks focused attention on the words and singing
  - Choruses often represented a kind of Everyman
  - Tragedies dealt with such deeply disturbing issues as incest and murder
    - Aristotle believed that watching such dramas provoked *katharsis*, or cleansing
  - Both tragedy and comedy were watched by the whole community
    - In effect they reinforced the democracy by providing a space for egalitarian performances
- The Akropolis
  - Under Perikles, the Akropolis was systematically and comprehensively rebuilt
    - It became the focal point for the expression of Athenian pride, both as a democratic state and an imperial power
  - The Parthenon replaced an older building on the south side of the Akropolis and was most likely paid for by the tribute received by the Athenians from the allies
  - The decoration of the Parthenon was revolutionary, depicting the Athenians performing the Panathenaic procession
  - The Propylaia and the Erechtheion also demonstrate the Periklean building program, designed to coordinate the many disparate cult sites of the Akropolis into one harmonious whole
    - Parts of the older buildings were still visible, offering tangible signs of the Akropolis's deep antiquity and sanctity
- Power and Exclusion
  - Athens was structured around twin poles of inclusion and exclusion
    - Foremost among those excluded from power and participation in civic life were Athenian women
  - Creation stories and early poetry reveal a deeply misogynistic vein in Athenian culture, also evident in sources of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, such as the works of Thucydides and Xenophon
  - Even a celebrated case, such as Lysias's speech on the Murder of Eratosthenes, reveals that a case of adultery was framed to an Athenian audience as principally a violation of the husband's rights
  - Sexual exploitation of women was common
  - Male sexuality also reflected uneven power dynamics
    - The Athenians practiced a form of pederasty that involved praising the beauty of boys and, if possible, seducing them
    - The difference between this and the exploitation of women was that boys were supposed to outgrow the role of *eromenos* on the way to becoming men
- Slavery
  - The most excluded members of Athenians society were slaves
  - From agricultural workers and miners to household slaves, the unfree provided the labor that made Greek culture possible
  - Slavery was omnipresent in Greek society and rarely questioned
  - A final excluded category are the metics, resident aliens who carried on much of Athens' commercial life and who rarely, if ever, were permitted citizenship



## Summary 10: Religion and Philosophy: Belief and Knowledge in the Classical Age

- Polis Religion
  - Religion and religious activities shaped the lives of the Greeks from birth to death
    - Coming of age for boys and girls was marked by religious ritual
  - The presence of sacrifice at every corner of social life shows that correct religious action played an enormous role in the lives of the Greeks
  - Recent discoveries of purification rites and sacred calendars remind us that the rhythm of daily life involved a continuous cycle of sacrificial and religious performances by the individual, by the local community, and by the state
- Conventional Belief
  - At the beginning of the 5th century BC, Athens in particular was a deeply conventional society in which the gods were seen as an active, integral part of daily life
  - Wearing very human faces, the gods of the Greeks were approachable and could be swayed, although the piety of the Greeks was deeply tinged by fear of the gods' power
  - To understand Greek religion it is valuable to keep in mind that it was not a religion of the book
    - No scripture dictated what a person must believe
    - Not only was the emphasis on action but it was also possible to recognize one's god in another's
    - Greek religion was not exclusive or proselytizing
- Splintering of Belief
  - The evolution of scientific medicine contributed a challenge to conventional thinking
    - Even as the cult of Asklepios was growing in popularity, so too the medical writing of Hippokrates and his students shows a new emphasis on empirical knowledge
  - The threat to conventional thinking also came from the Ionian philosophers of the 6th and 5th centuries BC, whose cosmological speculation had little place for the traditional gods
    - Instead they postulated a limitless universe, cosmic principles of elements in endless opposition, and a universe in constant flux
  - Some derided conventional views of the gods and castigated the venerable stories of Homer and Hesiod for making the gods as weak and venal as humans
  - The clash between new and old systems of thinking was commented on by contemporary commentators, such as Aristophanes
- Herodotos and Thucydides
  - The contrasting styles of Herodotos and Thucydides reveals the way that historiography mirrors the larger tensions and changes affecting the Greek world and Athens in particular
  - Though barely a generation apart, they employ very different methods
    - Herodotos relies on stories, dreams, oracles, and portents as if his writing were still influenced by Homer
      - He looks back to the world of the 6th century and earlier.
    - Thucydides writes in the manner of a pre-Socratic philosopher, banishing the gods from his account and instead trying to explain how warfare releases the worst human impulses
      - For him, the disease of a sick society can be analyzed in the same way as a Hippokratic doctor can read the symptoms of a sick body



## Summary 11: The Peloponnesian War

- Warfare and the Greeks
  - Warfare was a long-established staple of Greek life
    - Much early warfare consisted of border crossing and raiding
  - In the 6th century BC, hoplite warfare, conducted by heavily armed infantrymen in phalanx formation, emerged as the dominant mode of conflict
  - This development helped the emergence of democratic societies, in which men who fought side by side also served as fully enfranchised citizens
  - The establishment of democracy under Kleisthenes also saw the Athenian army adopt a high profile on the eve of the Persian Wars
  - Over the course of the 5th century BC the Athenians developed a formula for success: broad democracy, naval power, and imperial hegemony relied on and reinforced each other
- Causes of the Peloponnesian War
  - Sparta and Athens had followed divergent paths for some time
    - They spoke different dialects and exercised hegemony in different spheres
    - One was a conservative, inward-looking land power, the other a restless, outward-looking sea power
  - In the 430s a series of crises pushed the two states towards war
  - In 435 BC at Corcyra the Athenians intervened in a dispute between two Corinthian colonies: Epidamnos and Corcyra
    - In 433 BC at Potidaia the Athenians again provoked the Corinthians by laying siege to a Corinthian colony
  - The final straw was the Megarian Decree, an embargo on Megara imposed by the Athenians
  - All of these episodes represented an aggressive stance adopted by the Athenians, usually at the expense of Corinthian interests
- The Archidamian War
  - The first phase of the war lasted for a decade, during which the Spartans invaded each year
    - Following Perikles' policy, the Athenians relied on their walls for defense and brought supplies to the city by sea
  - Unexpectedly the city was devastated by a typhoid plague in the opening years of the war
    - Not only did this devastate Athens and demoralize the Athenians, it also took off Perikles
  - In the void left by the death of Perikles, Kleon emerged as the leading man
    - Violent and given to brinksmanship, he participated in two notable campaigns
    - He succeeded in capturing 420 Spartan hoplites on the island of Sphakteria but died in 422 BC at the battle of Amphipolis, along with the energetic Spartan general Brasidas
  - Both sides used these developments as an excuse to sign a peace treaty, the Peace of Nikias, in 421 BC
  - Peace did not last, but regional conflicts occupied the next campaigning seasons until the Athenians escalated the conflict
- The Sicilian Expedition
  - Between 415 and 413 BC the Athenians undertook a disastrous campaign in Sicily
    - Ostensibly undertaken to help the Athenian ally, Segesta, against the neighboring state of Selinous, in fact the campaign was an invasion designed to subdue Sicily and make it a part of Athens' empire
  - The campaign began in chaos, when statues of Hermes in Athens were desecrated on the eve of the fleet's departure
    - Shortly later, Alkibiades, a supporter of the expedition but implicated in the affair of the Hermes, jumped ship and defected to Sparta
  - For the next two seasons, the Athenians were led by Nikias, who proved to be a weak and vacillating commander
  - A great deal of the Athenian campaign consisted of building siege walls in an increasingly desperate attempt to capture Syracuse, the biggest and wealthiest Sicilian city
  - The campaign came to a climax in 413 BC during the Night Battle on the heights above Epipolai
    - Confused and demoralized, the Athenians were routed
  - In the weeks that followed the Athenian fleet was twice defeated
    - The remaining forces tried to flee by land but were cut off and captured
    - Nikias and Demosthenes were executed
- The Dekelean War
  - Despite the disaster in Sicily, the Athenians proved resilient
    - Even when an oligarchic coup saw the suspension of democracy in Athens, the fleet on Samos remained loyal to the spirit of the Athenian democracy
  - Following a defeat of the Spartans in 410 BC, democracy was restored in Athens and the city fought on
  - In the last phase of the war the Spartans built a permanent garrison on Athenian soil at Dekelea
  - The theater of war moved to the Hellespont, where Lysander attempted to choke off the Athenian grain supply
  - In 405 BC Lysander's fleet defeated the Athenians at the Battle of Aegospotamoi
  - The news reached Athens, and the Athenians faced the question of how they would be treated now that their empire was finished



## Summary 12: Panhellenism and the Rise of Philip

- Athens in Crisis
  - In the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, Lysander sailed into the port of Piraeus to take command of a defeated Athens
  - The Long Walls were dismantled
    - Most of the fleet was destroyed. Athens was reduced to dependence on Sparta
  - The Thirty, an oligarchy installed by Lysander, ruled oppressively and quickly became unpopular
  - Within a year a democratic resistance sprang up, eventually forcing the Thirty out and reinstating the democracy
- Sokrates
  - After the expulsion of the Thirty, the Athenians decided upon an amnesty
  - Nevertheless, the scars of the Thirty's reign ran deep and the period was one of anxiety
  - Although Sokrates had been regarded as something of a caricature earlier in his career, he was associated with the Thirty because he had been the teacher of Kritias, one of the leaders of the Thirty
  - His trial can be seen as a culmination of the religious anxieties and social tensions that had become more pronounced over the course of the Peloponnesian War
    - In other words, his trial served as the nearest thing to a political trial after the reign of the Thirty that could be conducted despite the amnesty that accompanied the restoration of democracy
- Spartan Hegemony
  - As victors, the Spartans enjoyed a new hegemony over many Greek states
  - Their rule was heavy-handed, involving the imposition of pro-Spartan oligarchies and garrisons
    - Their aggressions in Asia Minor prompted the Great King to subsidize a coalition against Sparta during the Corinthian War
    - This was followed by a Peace Treaty promulgated by the Great King to settle the war
  - The Athenian response was a cautious rebuilding of alliances, culminating in the Second Athenian Confederacy
  - Spartan authority remained heavy-handed in the Peloponnese, where they intervened in the internal affairs of neighboring states
  - The Sparta hegemony came to an end in 371 BC when they were comprehensively defeated by the Thebans at the Battle of Leuktra
  - The Theban hegemony lasted for less than ten years, but witnessed the founding of Messene in the land of the newly liberated Messenians, and Megalopolis in Arkadia
- Regionalism
  - Despite the continuing cycle of wars and successive hegemonies, the early 4th century BC is more than a repetition of earlier mistakes
  - A series of Common Peace Treaties, even if finally ineffectual, demonstrate that the Greek city-states were attempting to break the cycle of interstate violence
  - Leagues and federations, always a feature of Greek political and religious life, also became a notable feature of the political landscape
    - These regional groupings grew from a tendency to look for strength through aggregation
  - The final application of this principle was Panhellenism
    - Also a well-established feature of Greek life, in the fourth century bc Panhellenism took on fresh vitality as policy for unifying the Greeks
    - The 4th-century version of this, however, involved advocating a new Persian War
- Philip
  - Philip's career should be viewed against the backdrop of Macedonian history
    - Long marginalized, the Macedonians were looked down upon by the southern Greeks
  - His early career consisted on dynastic marriages and alliances designed to strengthen his control of Macedonia
  - His transformation of the Macedonian army saw the creation of a highly trained, professional, national army
  - He prosecuted plans for territorial expansion in every direction, coming into conflict with Athenian interests in the northern Aegean
  - By the mid-340s Philip had annexed territory as far south as Thermopylae
  - Once he had established the northern, western, and eastern borders of his expanded kingdom, he marched south
  - His victory at Chaironeia in 338 BC saw the end of the Classical order of independent Greek city-states and the beginning a new phase of Greek culture



## Summary 13: Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age

- Alexander's Early Reign
  - Alexander's reign began under a cloud
    - Philip had remarried in 337 BC, and a new heir would have been a threat to Alexander's position
    - When Philip was assassinated, Alexander moved quickly to annihilate any threats to his position
  - After quelling revolts in Greece, Alexander undertook the Asian campaign planned by his father
  - After an early victory at the Granikos, he began sweeping through Asia Minor
  - After a second victory, at Issos, he continued south through the Levant and all the way to Egypt
    - At Siwah he may have been greeted as the son of Zeus, a message he exploited propagandistically
- The Conquest of the East
  - At Gaugamela (in modern-day Iraq) Alexander conquered Darius III and in effect took his place
  - He continued marching further east in pursuit of the last Achaemenid king
    - After Darius was murdered by Bessos, Alexander pursued Bessos and executed him
  - Although the campaigns in the eastern satrapies are the stuff of romance and legend, Alexander's policy of founding cities points to a more serious purpose: annexing the nodes of an emerging trade route from China
  - The presence of Greeks in central Asia would not last long in terms of kingdoms and states, but the cultural fusion of Greek and Buddhist art from Gandhara points to the cross-fertilization of art and ideas
  - After turning south Alexander sought more provinces to conquer but after reaching northwestern India he was forced back after his men mutinied
  - He died in Babylon in 324 BC
- Ptolemaic Egypt
  - Alexander's generals carved a series of independent kingdoms from the carcass of Alexander's empire
    - The most successful of these was Ptolemaic Egypt
  - The Ptolemies inherited and refined a highly controlled state apparatus that oversaw a centralized economy
  - In Alexandria they sponsored a religious system that merged Greek and Egyptian cult practices, notably in the cult of Serapis
  - They presented themselves as pharaohs, adapting and adopting pharaonic practices, such as the continuing worship of the Apis bull
- Seleukids and Attalids
  - The Seleukids controlled much of the old Achaemenid realm, from Syria east to the edge of Iran
  - They too presented themselves as a renewal of an older dynasty, in this case the kings of Babylon
  - Seleukid history is often presented as 300 years of continuous decline, but they may have learned Alexander's lesson regarding control of the trade routes of central Asia
    - Controlling caravan routes and imposing taxes was a more profitable approach to empire than the control of vast swathes of territory
  - The Attalids controlled an even smaller domain, centered on Pergamon, but amassed great wealth
  - In common with the other dynasties, the Attalids craved legitimacy that they attempted to win by sumptuous acts of benefaction
    - Grain, money, and building were all given by the dynasties to key Greek cities and sanctuaries as ways of enhancing the dynasty's prestige
- Rome
  - Rome's involvement in the Greek world takes place after the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC
    - His failure, despite repeated successes, points to the astonishing reserves of manpower that Rome was capable of deploying in the field each year
  - Rome's move east was the result of many factors, not least of which was the impetus of each cohort of elite Romans to win glory in battle so as to amass wealth and political influence
  - Constantly responding to the threats of Hellenistic kings, successive waves of Roman armies fought further and further east after the defeat of Carthage in 202 BC
  - Rome's eastern entanglements had led to a change of policy by 146 BC
    - In the same year that Carthage was destroyed, so too was Corinth, while Macedonia was annexed as a Roman province
  - As Rome moved to absorb the Hellenistic east into the Roman imperium, more Greeks entered Rome, profoundly influencing the development of Roman culture
  - The melding of these cultures might have led to a true fusion, had Marc Antony and Cleopatra been victorious at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC
    - Instead Octavian was the victor and the entire Greek east was absorbed into the Roman empire
