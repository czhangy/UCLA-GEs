# JAPAN 80 - Winter '20 - Yamazaki

## **1/10: Discussion 1**

- Reading Points: Tom Gunning
  - "Making Sense of Film"
    - Unique qualities and use as historical evidence
      - Objectivity and editing
        - Can create stories of events that didn't happen in reality
      - Film unlikely to capture key historical moments
    - How to approach film as part of social/cultural history
      - Record of daily life
      - Who made the film and for what purpose
        - Was it a government, religious association, etc.
          - Think about the intended audience and purpose
      - Who is the audience and what perspective does the film reflect?
  - "Film Criticism"
    - Domination of historical and theoretical methods
    - Should not dismiss evaluative film criticism
    - Where do our evaluative categories come from? How do they shape what we write about?
    - Strength of film criticism = focus on the individual feature
- Reading Points: Davidson and Wittgenstein
  - Davidson:
    - An "agent" exercises ability to act intentionally, but some actions invoke unintended actions
    - We judge action as disclosing something about agent identity
    - Action is a realization of freedom against the reality of the external environment
  - Wittgenstein:
    - Relationship between inner life and external behavior is more complicated than "action reveals intentional movement," or "external behavior exemplifies internal character"
  - Action is not just intentional movement, but something more complex

## **1/14: Animation and Cinema**

- Agent, symptom, and reflexive critique
  - Not film as a reflection of society
    - Not homogenous culture
  - Film as an agent - what does it do?
    - Promote new forms of life
      - Heterosociality, autonomous subject, commodity culture
    - Shifting understanding of identity, belonging - exploration not limited by reality
      - Cultural nationalism
      - Also dislocation, deterritorialization
  - Film as a symptom
    - Film as part of burgeoning capitalist mass culture
    - History of cinema → history of modernization
  - Film as reflexive critique
    - Experience of cinema models "modernization without modernity"
    - Not tradition vs. modernity but inescapable condition of life
- Animation and Cinema - Colin Williamson
  - Cinema **is** Animation
    - Creation of sequential motion; the illusion of motion
    - Animation of pictures
  - Animation bestows animate-ness on an inanimate entity, "modern magic"
    - Power of vivification
  - Animation provides "a forum for achieving something like an intuitive or sensory understanding of the ‘effectiveness' of moving images and their uncanny metamorphoses" (Williamson on Eisenstein)
- Revealing life vs. giving life

## **1/17: Discussion 2**

- Things to consider:
  - Cinematography
  - Editing
  - Mise-en-scene
  - Sound
    - Diegetic (sounds the characters can hear/with a source onscreen)
    - Non-Diegetic
  - Performance
- Tips:
  - Syllabus policy (-25% every hour)
  - Address the prompt
  - Cite quotes
  - You do not need to cover everything
  - No singular truth - only persuasive arguments
  - Be careful:
    - Do not essentialize
    - Make generalizations unsupported by film evidence
- Reading Points:
  - "Our capacity to recognize agency in action (behavior that looks like intent) backfires in our experience of an artform like film"
    - Relationship between animate and inanimate objects
  - Animation and Cinema
    - Convergence of performance magic and early animation practices
      - Flip book (illusion) vs. blow book (shock)
      - "What bearly animation archives is the bestowal of animate-ness on an inanimate entity, not the revelation of animate-ness where it is otherwise imperceptible"
  - Stern:
    - Uncanny as a sensation
      - Seemingly novel, but always a return
      - Frightening
      - Involuntary
      - Likely to experience in familiar situations
      - Doubling, dividing, interchanging of self
    - The cinematic body as one that is simultaneously moved and is moved
- Discussion: Paprika
  - Agency:
    - Split between Paprika and Chiba
      - Emphasized by feelings towards Tokita
      - Physical split
    - In the rescue scene:
      - Chiba is inside Paprika, unconscious state = lack of agency
  - Time: cycles of dreams
    - Movie sequence in Kanagawa's dream
  - Space: dreamspace → external or internal?
    - Same space contrasts (reversal of roles)
    - Multitude of selves, actions across multiple levels of consciousness

## **1/21: Narrative and Attractions**

  - "Cinema of attractions"
    - Display/exhibition
    - Shock/surprise at the expense of a story
    - Different relationship between the film and the viewer
      - Narrative = suspense
      - Attractions = surprise
- Reading Points: Sontag
  - Reduction of art to its content
  - Act of interpretation as translation
    - Alters the meaning of the original
    - Conceals itself by professing to disclose "true meaning"
  - Film as a medium that can resist interpretation
    - Hard for us to grasp at things to translate
  - Development of a vocabulary for forms that is descriptive (how or that something is) rather than prescriptive (what it means)
- Reading Points: Bordwell

- Japanese Cinema before the 1920s:
  - Kyugeki/Kyuha - old drama, kabuki style period drama
  - Shinpa - new school, or modern drama
  - The mixed-media rensageki - chain drama, a mixture of cinema and theater
- Japanese Cinema after the 1920s:
  - Jidaigeki - literally meaning period drama, films set in pre-Meiji Restoration

- Mackinnon: "Women, Self-Possession, and Sport"

  - Potential Problems:
    - Current understanding of autonomy as promoting masculinist ideas of personhood
